        "answer": "We have all heard:Mutual Fund investmentsare subject to market risks.Ever wondered what are these risks?The imageon the left talks about the various types of risks.Not all risks impact all the fund schemes. TheScheme Information Document (SID)helps understand which risks apply to your selected scheme.So how does the fund management team manage these risks?It all depends on what type of investments the Mutual Fund has invested in. Certain securities are more sensitive to certain risks and some are exposed to some other.Professional help, diversification and SEBIs regulations help mitigate risks in Mutual Funds.Finally, and the most important question that many investors have asked: Can a Mutual Fund company run away with my money? This is just not possible given the structure of Mutual Funds as well as the strong regulations.2854",

        "answer": "KYC is an acronym for \"Know Your Customer\" and is a term used for Customer Identification Process as a part of Account Opening process with any financial entity. KYC establishes an investors identity & address through relevant supporting documents such as prescribed photo id (e.g., PAN card, Aadhar card) and address proof and In-Person Verification (IPV). KYC compliance is mandatory under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 and Rules framed there under, read with the SEBI Master Circular on Anti Money Laundering (AML) Standards/ Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) /Obligations of Securities Market Intermediaries.A Know Your Customer (KYC) is generally divided in 2 parts:Part I contains the basic anduniform KYCdetails of the investor as prescribed by the Central KYC registry (Uniform KYC) to be used by all registered financial intermediaries andPart II additional KYC information as may be sought separately by the financial intermediary such as aMutual Fund, stock broker, depository participant opening the investors account (Additional KYC).2",

        "question": "When should I start investing in Mutual Funds?",
        "answer": "There is a beautiful Chinese proverb,The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.There is no reason why one should delay ones investments, except, of course, when there is no money to invest. Within that, it is always better to useMutual Fundsthan to do-it-oneself.There is no minimum age when one can start investing. The moment one starts earning and saving, one can startinvesting in Mutual Funds. In fact, even kids can open their investment accounts with Mutual Funds out of the money they receive once in a while in form of gifts during their birthdays or festivals. Similarly, there is no upper age forinvesting in Mutual Funds.Mutual Funds have many different schemes suitable for different purposes. Some are suitable for growth over long periods, whereas some may be for those in need of safety with regular income, and some provide liquidity in the short term, too.You see, whatever stage of life one is in, or whatever ones requirements, Mutual Funds may have solutions for each one.2",

        "question": "Do Mutual Funds invest only in stocks?",
        "answer": "Do you visualize roller-coasters or toy trains first when you think of an amusement park? Probably the former. These rides are usually the biggest attractions in such parks which create a certain perception about amusement parks. Mutual funds too carry a similar perception that they invest only in stocks and hence are risky. There are many types of Mutual Funds meant for the varying investment needs of people. Some investors want high returns which only stocks can deliver. Such investors can invest in Equity Mutual Funds which are among thebest long-term investmentoptions available for achieving such objectives. But theseMutual Fundshave risk of higher volatility  because of their exposure to stocks of various companies.There are other types of Mutual Funds that do not invest in equity but in bonds issued by banks, companies, government bodies and money market instruments (bank CDs, T-bills, Commercial Papers,) which have lower risk but also offer lower returns compared to equity funds. These funds are better suited as alternatives to traditional options like bank fixed deposits orPPFs. Hence if you are looking to invest your money that can give you better returns than a bank or post office FDs and still be more tax efficient, Debt Mutual Funds are a great way to achieve suchfinancial goals.2",

        "question": "What are the indicators of risk in a Mutual Fund Scheme?",
        "answer": "You must properly evaluate before picking up the rightMutual Fund schemeto invest your hard-earned money. While investors often go by scheme category and top performing schemes in the category, they ignore risk indicators for these schemes. When you are comparing schemes to choose from, dont miss out comparing their riskiness. While there are many risk indicators like Standard Deviation, Beta, and Sharpe Ratio provided in the factsheet of every scheme, product label is the most basic thing to look for. The riskometer in the label shows the risk level of the fund.This riskometer is a mandatory requirement bySEBIand represents the underlying risk associated with the fund. The six levels of risk ranging from low, low to moderate, moderate, moderately high, high, and very high have been linked to various categories of mutual funds depending on the level of risk in their portfolio. Since this kind of risk categorization has been defined by SEBI, allMutual Fundsare bound to categorize similar kinds of funds into the same risk category.Apart from the riskometer which gives an overview of the funds riskiness, one can also look at more specific risk indicators provided in the factsheet. Standard Deviation measures the range of a funds return. A scheme with a higher standard deviation of return indicates its range of performance is wide, implying greater volatility.Beta measures a funds volatility with respect to the market. Beta >1 implies the scheme will be more volatile than the market and Beta<1 means itll be less volatile than the market. Beta of 1 indicates the scheme will move in tandem with market volatility.Sharpe Ratio measures the excess return provided by the fund per unit of risk undertaken. It is a good indicator of risk-adjusted return.Next time you research on which scheme to invest in, dont forget to evaluate them on the above risk parameters.2854",

        "answer": "If you are wonderinghow to invest in a Mutual Fund, remember it is mandatory to have an account with any bank, KYC / CKYC, PAN and Aadhaar cards. This has been made mandatory to ensure Mutual Funds are not used for money laundering purposes by few unscrupulous investors. SomeMutual Fundsand banks have a common parent company i.e. they belong to the same corporate conglomerate. However, banks are governed by the RBI and Mutual Fund businesses are regulated bySEBI. While you may come across a Mutual Fund company that carries the same brand name as a well-established bank, remember that they are two different companies which are being run independently. You dont need to have a savings account with the bank to invest in the funds of its sister concern, i.e. the Mutual Fund company in this case.Banks also work as distributors ofvarious Mutual Fundsand cross-sell these funds to their customers. While they may not sell all the Mutual Funds available in the market, theyll pitch funds from those Mutual Funds with whom they have a distribution tie-up. You can invest in these Mutual Funds which are not related to the bank selling them, i.e. your bank where you have an account.2",

        "question": "How do Mutual Funds help manage risk?",
        "answer": "Risks appear in many forms. For example, if you own a share of a company, there is a Price Risk or a Market Risk or a Company Specific Risk. The share of just that company may dip or even crash due to any of the above reasons or even a combination of these reasons.However, in aMutual Fund, a typical portfolio holds many securities, thus offering diversification. In fact, diversification is one of the biggestbenefits of investing in a Mutual Fund. It ensures that the dip in price of one or even a few securities does not affect portfolio performance alarmingly.Another important risk to bear in mind is Liquidity Risk. What isliquidity? It is the ease in converting an asset into cash. Suppose an investor has an investment that is locked in for say 10 years, and she requires money in the 3rdyear. This presents a typical liquidity problem. Her priority at this point is access to cash and not returns. Mutual Funds byregulationand structure, offer tremendous liquidity. Portfolios are designed to offer an investor, ease of investing and redemption.2854",

        "answer": "Banks are in the business of savings and loans while Mutual Funds are for investments. When you put your money in a savings account or in a fixed deposit, you are making savings whereas when you put your money in Mutual Funds, you are making investments. Banking and Mutual Funds are two completely different businesses, requiring specific domain and organizational expertise. Banks are governed by RBI whileMutual Fundsare regulated bySEBI. If some corporate wants to be in the business of banking and Mutual Funds, it must seek separate license permits from the respective regulators and run these two businesses as different companies.You may come across some banks that also have a Mutual Fund business. But both are two different companies with no functional linkages and does not guarantee returns just because the bank has a sound track record.Most banks today function as distributor of many financial products including Mutual Funds. They operate as a sales channel for the Mutual Funds that have tied up with them (banks) for distribution. Hence, if you are wonderinghow to invest in Mutual Fundsand want to approach a bank, remember that the bank may not be selling all the funds available in the market.2",

        "question": "What happens when the market falls midway while you have invested for a longer term?",
        "answer": "Mutual Fund investors withlong-term investmentsthrough SIPs constantly worry about market falls during this period.SIPsare well-designed to overcome some of theMutual Fund riskslike market timing and volatility.You can beat market volatility through rupee-cost averaging, by investing regularly inMutual Fundsthrough SIPs. Here you buy more units whenNAVis low and vice versa. The cost per unit is averaged out over the long run if NAVs move both ways. For example, if you invest INR 1,000/- per month, you get 100 units if the NAV is INR 10 and 200 units if NAV drops to INR 5. Over longertime period, the average price per unit will fall if markets move in both directions thus helping to lower volatility of returns as well.If you invest in lump sum, number of units would remain the same during the entire holding period, but their value would go down with falling NAV during market downturns. If you hold your lumpsum investment in anequity fundfor long (say over 7-8years), the occasional blips shouldnt impact your returns as markets usually move up over the long-term. You might end up with a far higher NAV than what you started with.2854",

        "answer": "In Mutual Funds, one often hears, more the risk, more the return. Is there truth in this?If risk is measured as either, probability of loss of capital or as swings and fluctuations in investment value, then asset classes like equity are undoubtedly the riskiest, and money in a savings bank account or in a government bond is of course least risky.In theMutual Fundsuniverse, aliquid fundis least risky and anequity fundis most risky.So, the only reason to invest in equity would be an expectation of higher reward. However, higher returns come to those who invest in equity after careful study and adopting a patient, long term time horizon. In fact, risk in equity can be mitigated by adopting diversification as well having a longer term time horizon.Every category ofmutual fund schemeshave different types of risks  credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, market/price risk, business risk, event risk, regulatory risk, etc. The knowledge of financial experts like your mutual fund distributor / investment advisor and thefund manager, along with diversification, can help mitigate them.2",

        "answer": "When a Mutual Fund Company shuts down or gets sold off, it is a serious matter to note for any existing investor. However, as Mutual Funds are regulated bySEBI, events of such kind have a prescribed process.In the case of a Mutual Fund company shutting down, either the trustees of the fund have to approach SEBI for approval to close or SEBI by itself can direct a fund to shut. In such cases, all investors are returned their funds based on the last available net asset value, before winding up.If aMutual Fundis acquired by another fund house, then there are usually two options. One, the schemes continue in their original format, albeit with a new fund house overseeing it. Or, the acquired schemes are merged with schemes in the new fund house. SEBI approval is required for all Asset Management Company (AMC) Mergers and Acquisitions, as well as scheme level mergers too.In all such cases, investors are given an option to exit the schemes with no load being levied. Any action by investor or fund house is ALWAYS done at prevailingNet Asset Value.2",

        "question": "Then why does the disclaimer say Mutual Funds are subject to market risk?",
        "answer": "Mutual Funds invest in securities and the nature of securities depends on the schemes objective.For instance, an equity or growth fund would invest in company shares. Aliquid fundwould invest in Certificates of Deposit and Commercial Paper.All of these securities are however traded in the Market. Company shares are bought and sold through the stock exchange, which is part of the Capital Market. Similarly, debt instruments like Government Securities, can be traded through a platform at the Stock Exchange or through specialised systems called NDS. These serve as markets to buy and sell securities and the buyers and sellers are diverse. So, the entire process of buying and selling, and price determination is done by the market.The price of any security is dependent on market forces, and the market acts on any news or development, making it difficult to predict the direction of the market, it's impossible to predict the price of a share or security in the short term. There are too many factors and players that influence its direction.Thus, every investor should know that there always exists a certain risk to security price from an all-important entity known as the Market. They should also know thatMutual Fundsare designed to reduce this risk as much as possible.2",

So it may appear that zeroing on a scheme is actually a very complex and confusing affair.Choosing the scheme to invest in should be the last thing in an investors mind. There are several more important steps before that, which will help remove much confusion later.An investor should first of all have an investment objective, say retirement planning or renovating ones house. The investor has to arrive at two figures  how much would this cost and how long it would take, while also knowing how much risk can be taken.In other words, based on an investors goals and objectives and risk profile, a type of fund is recommended, say equity or hybrid or debt, and only then specific schemes are selected, based on track record, , portfolio fit etc.In essence, if there is clarity of investment purpose in the beginning, there would be a lot less confusion about choice of fund in the end.2",

        "answer": "Many investors worry about loss inMutual Fundsif they are unable to makeSIPpayments during its tenure. Such situations can arise due to many reasons like you are undergoing some financial difficulty or uncertainty about job or business income. Its natural that under such situations you may not be able to continue with your regular SIP payments. Since SIPs are a long-term investment option, its fine if you skip a few payments in-between. Unlike an insurance policy where non-payment of annual premium can lead to policy inactivation, here your investments made so far will continue to earn a return and you can withdraw it anytime. However, you would accumulate lower wealth thanwhat you had initially expected and may miss your financial goals if you are too irregular with your SIP.While Mutual Fund companies dont penalize for non-payment of SIP instalments, your SIP will automatically be cancelled if you fail to make the payments for three consecutive months.Also your bank will penalize you for dishonoring the auto debit payments. Hence,it is advisable to stop the SIP by sending a request atleast 30days in advance if you foresee a cash crunch in future. Start a fresh SIP later whenever you feel financially comfortable.2",

        "answer": "Its a misconception that Debts Fund have no risk just because they dont invest in equities. Its true that Debt Funds are less risky compared to Equity Funds but that doesnt mean Debt Funds guarantee that your money will never face any loss. Debt funds invest in debt and money market securities that are prone to different kind of risk factors as compared to equity funds that invest in stock market.Debt Fundsare exposed to interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk that are quite different from the stock market risk we all are familiar with. While these risk factors are not as pronounced as stock market risk on an everyday basis, they cant be ignored completely.Interest rate risk arises due to changes in interest rates that affect the prices of bonds the Debt Fund has invested in. Credit risk arises when there is a financial crisis in any of the companies whose bonds the debt fund has invested in because this makes the payment of interest and principal due on these bonds extremely uncertain. Liquidity risk arises in case of debt securities that are not frequently traded and hence the fund may be forced to sell these securities in its portfolio at a loss under unfavourable circumstances. Hence investing in Debt Funds may be relatively less risky as compared toEquity Fundsbut not completely risk-free.3",

Corporate bond funds and hybrid funds are best suited for capital appreciation as they are less volatile compared toequity fundswhich are ideal for wealth creation over long-term. Corporate bond funds invest in high quality bonds with 3-5 years average maturity, becoming less sensitive to interest rate changes.Hybrid fundsinvest predominantly in debt with some equity exposure thus providing a safer investment option with potential for capital appreciation.While evaluating funds for medium-term investments, look beyond the recent 3-5 years returns for thefunds long-term performance.See if it has been a consistent performer through all phases of a market cycle. Most funds will perform well during a secular bull run i.e. when markets are trending upwards, but a fund giving superior return during market downturn will exhibit consistent returns over time. Since you want to invest for 3-5 years and if the market happens to be in a bearish mood during this time, you would benefit from investing in the consistent performers.

Even in case of aSIP, there is a term for which investments need to be made regularly. If the investor passes away while the SIP term is on or before the maturity of a close-ended scheme, there are defined procedures to be followed by the nominee, survivors in case of joint holding or legal heirs to claim the proceeds. This process is called transmission. For someone to request for a transmission, the person must be aware of your Mutual Fund investments in the first place, else it can just remain unclaimed forever.Hence, it is advisable to always add a nominee to yourMutual Fund investmentsjust like any other investments and keep the nominee informed about it.

        "question": "How to choose a fund basis your risk appetite",
        "answer": "Mutual Funds are market-linked products that carry various kinds of risks and their returns are not guaranteed. Choosing the right mutual fund involves not only looking at its investment objective, return potential but also an evaluation of its riskiness. Since every investor has a unique personality including risk preference, the choice of mutual funds will be unique to each investor. Apart from risk preference, every investor will have a certain goal in mind that would be unique in its value and time horizon. Hence choosing the rightMutual Fundsrequires one to evaluate various funds along with the risk-return-time horizon metric.Lets understand this with an example. A 30 year old and a 50 year old may both be investing for retirement, but their choice of funds will be different. The 30 year old can take a much higher risk as he/she has 25-30 years left but the 50-year old has to be very cautious in his/her selection because he has just 8-10 yrs left for this goal.Select a fund whose risk profile matches your risk appetite. If you prefer less risk, choose a debt fund. If you dont mind taking risk, look for a suitable equity fund. If you prefer moderate risk, look for a hybrid fund. Thus, the starting point for fund selection should be how much risk you are willing to take.2",

        "question": "Are fund managers necessary?",
        "answer": "The answer is a huge, resounding YES! It is important to note that experience in managing money/making investments plays a vital role in generating good performance. The more the experience, the better is the probability of making profitable investment decisions.The fund manager is similar to a surgeon in an operation theatre. Though it is the surgeon who actually does the critical operational procedure, he is assisted by assistant surgeons, anaesthetists, nurses and other support staff. Similarly, the fund manager is assisted by the research team, junior fund managers and an operations team. Just as a surgeon has all the latest equipment to ensure a successful operation, the fund manager has access to the latest information, reports and analysis.An experienced fund manager would have seen many economic cycles, business developments, political and policy changes. Such issues have a bearing on investment performance. Since all these issues are normally beyond the grasp of an average investor, a fund manager brings not just their own expertise and competence, but also the collective wisdom from the information and data that he has access to.2",

        "question": "How is the Riskometer for a scheme is derived?",
        "answer": "The riskometer attempts to give you a complete risk picture for themutual fund scheme. It does this by puttinga risk score on every asset class held by the mutual fund scheme. Each debt or equity instrument and other assets, such as cash, gold, and other financial instruments found in mutual fund portfolios, is assigned a particular risk value.In the case of equities, each position in the portfolio is assigned a risk score based on three main factors:Market Capitalization:Small-cap stocks pose more risk than mid-cap stocks, which in turn are riskier than large-cap stocks. The risk value for each is updated every six months.Volatility:Stocks with substantial daily price fluctuations are assigned a higher risk value. This is calculated from a stock's price behaviour over the past two years.Impact Cost (Liquidity)1:Stocks with low trading volumes experience significant price shifts in large transactions. This raises the impact cost and corresponding risk value. This risk value is based on the three-month average impact cost, including the current month being evaluated.For debt securities, risk assessment involves the following factors:Credit Risk2:The risk value is lower for higher credit ratings (e.g., AAA/G-Sec/SDL/TREPS) and increases for securities with below-investment-grade ratings. This shift happens due to the rising likelihood of default in unrated and below-investment-grade securities.Interest-Rate Risk:This risk is determined by using the Macaulay Duration of the portfolio. Bonds with longer maturity period have higher risk values due to their heightened sensitivity to fluctuations in interest rates.Liquidity Risk3:Liquidity risk assessment considers factors like listing status, credit rating, and debt instrument structure.Additionally,SEBIhas issued comprehensive guidelines for assigning risk values to other asset classes such as cash & net current assets, derivatives, gold, foreign securities, REITs & InvITs and more.The total risk score is calculated by averaging each asset's risk value in amutual fund portfolio.Lastly, this risk score is used to map the fund scheme to a certain risk level (i.e. Low, Moderately Low, Moderate, Moderately High, or High) on the riskometer .Risk LabelFunds Average Risk ScoreLow1Low to Moderate2Moderate3Moderately High4High5Very High6 or moreIt is important to note that theriskometerfor each mutual fund scheme is evaluated monthly. Mutual Funds/AMCs will display the updated riskometer and portfolio information on their website and the AMFI website within ten days of each month's conclusion.1. Impact Cost relies on how much the stock price changes when a large purchase or sale occurs.2. Credit risk indicates the likelihood of a borrower defaulting.3.

Mutual Fund regulations clearly define the roles and responsibilities of Asset Management Companies (AMC) and Custodians. Its vital to remember that every investor has to complete an effectiveKYC processbefore investing. Therefore, only bonafide investors with a valid PAN card can invest inMutual Fund schemes. Such investors also provide bank details so that all redemption proceeds are directly credited to an investors own account.SEBIalso ensures that all AMCs are supervised by a board of trustees, some of whom, have to necessarily be independent individuals.

However, as the name itself suggests, aMutual Fund distributoris more likely to be focused on Mutual Fund products, whereas an investment advisor may have a broader basket of products and services.Does it mean that a Mutual Fund distributor would sell any Mutual Fund scheme to the investors just to earn commission? Well, the regulations are very stringent in this regard. If a Mutual Fund distributor sells a Mutual Fund scheme that is not suitable for the investor that would qualify as mis-selling, which is an offence.A Mutual Fund distributor is required to understand the investors situation/risk profile and recommend products suitable for the investors needs at the time of recommendation. On the other hand, an investment advisor may look at a broader picture, which may include assessment of the investors assets, liabilities, income and expenses and recommend products.Both are registered entities and hence regulated, too.

In such cases, the amount invested may not yield the desired result.Redeeming too early: Investors sometimes lose patience or do not give the requisite time for an investment to provide the desired rate of return, and hence redeem prematurely.Joining the herd: Very often, investors do not exercise individual judgement and get carried away by the buzz in the market or media, and thus make the wrong choice.Investing without a plan: This is perhaps the biggest mistake.

        "answer": "Stock market investing can be intimidating, especially if you are a beginner. However, there's a tried and tested investment strategy that not only makes investing in the stock market simple and easy but can also help you build long-term wealth: SIPs or Systematic Investment Plans.Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) allow you to invest a small sum in mutual funds at regular intervals. By contributing a small amount of money on a regular basis, SIPs can help you harness the power of compounding to achieve your financial goals.A small amount of money invested in mutual fund schemes each month has the potential to grow into a significant investment portfolio over time. SIPs are an excellent investment option for those who are looking for a hassle-free and disciplined approach to investing. If you have any uncertainties regarding the suitability of the product/scheme, it is advisable to seek guidance from a mutual fund expert.Often, people are thrown off from investing in SIPs or mutual funds because they think it is too complex. They have difficulty understanding the mechanism of how it works, so they put off their investments.However, the cost of delaying your investment can be huge! Even if you invest just Rs 1,000 a month in a SIP, a delay of two years can cost you dearly!Dont believe it? Lets look at the numbers!Lets assume at 25, you want to invest Rs 1,000 in an equity SIP that earns you a return of 12% p.a. with a plan to stay invested for 30 years. Owing to some reason, you decide to start with the plan after two years. Your investment horizon then becomes 28 years. The table below demonstrates the potential returns you may encounter. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that these returns are subject to risks:DetailsStart at 25Start at 27Investment horizon3028Amount invested per monthRs 1,000Rs 1,000Assumed Return on Investment12%12%Invested amountRs 3,60,000Rs 3,36,000Total corpus accumulated with returnsRs 35,29,914Rs 27,58,585Cost of delayed investment-Rs 7,71,329* The above calculations are for illustration purposes only and are subject to risks.SIP in debt fund for that long a period is doubtful. Can consider maybe a hybrid fundAs you can see, a delay of just two years can cost you more than Rs 7 lakh! Now, even if you invested in a hybrid fund with an average return of 10% p.a., your cost of delayed investments would be in lakhs.DetailsStart at 25Start at 27Investment horizon3028Amount invested per monthRs 1,000Rs 1,000Assumed Return on Investment10%10%Invested amountRs 3,60,000Rs 3,36,000Total corpus accumulated with returnsRs 22,79,325Rs 18,45,849Cost of delayed investment-Rs 4,33,476* The above calculations are for illustration purposes only and are subject to risks.The Power of CompoundingThe power of compounding is a force in investments that allows you to earn interest on your principal investment as well as on the accumulated interest. This means that your earnings would have the potential to grow at an accelerating rate over time which may help you earn significant returns on your investment.If you start early, the compounding effect will be much more powerful, helping you meet your financial goals with ease. As the examples above explain, just a two-year delay can have a huge cost of delayed investments.This is why you should start investing as soon as you can. Even if you have just Rs 1,000 to invest a month, you should find a good mutual fund to invest in.Investing in mutual funds is easy and hassle-free. You can automate your investments online without having to worry about making monthly investments.Final WordAs you know, slow and steady wins the race.

A mutual fund, on the other hand, is an investment tool that consists of a portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities and is overseen by aprofessional fund manager.NPS Vs. Mutual Funds - Understanding Both the InvestmentsNPS:The National Pension System (NPS) is a voluntary pension scheme the Government of India launched to provide retirement income to Indian citizens. The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority regulates the scheme. It's a market-linked product that allows investors to invest in a combination of equity, corporate debt, government debt, and alternative assets.NPS offers two different types of accounts, Tier I and Tier II. Tier I account remains locked until the investor is 60 years of age. Meanwhile, Tier II is voluntary, and to be eligible to avail of this account, the investor will need to hold a Tier I account. Unlike Tier I, in Tier II accounts, the investor can withdraw funds anytime.The National Pension Scheme is an investment open for all citizens in the country, including unorganized sector workers. It is a structured retirement saving plan to provide financial security in old age. The contributions made in NPS are spread across different asset classes like Equity, Corporate Bonds, Government Securities, and more. However, the scheme offers flexibility in asset allocation through active choiceand auto choice.On reaching 60, the NPS account matures, and the investor can withdraw up to 60% of the maturity value as a lump sum payment. The balance of 40% can be used to purchase a regular pension annuity.Mutual Funds:A mutual fund is a professionally managed investment vehicle that pools money from various investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of assets, including stocks, bonds, and money market instruments. It simple terms, it is a pooled investment vehicle, where money is collected from investors who share a common investment objective.Various categories of mutual funds cater to diverse investment preferences, including active, passive, equity,fixed income, balanced funds, and more. Each fund type comes with its unique set of features, potential rewards, and associated risks. Notably, the majority of mutual funds offer flexibility by not imposing a lock-in period. This flexibility allows investors to align their choice of funds with their specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon, empowering them to make informed and personalized investment decisions.DisclaimerMutual Fund investmentsare subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.2",

        "answer": "An investor has no restriction on redeeming money from an open ended scheme. While there may be an exit load in certain cases, which impacts final amount realised, all open end schemes offer liquidity as a great benefit.The decision to redeem is totally at investors discretion. There are no restrictions on the number of redemptions, or on the amount to be redeemed. There have to be sufficient units in the account to fund redemptions. Scheme documents usually indicate minimum amount that can be redeemed.Units under lien to a bank or institution cannot be redeemed, unless the lien is removed. Redemptions may be restricted only under extraordinary circumstances, as decided by the Board of Trustees.Closed end schemes may be redeemed from the AMC only on maturity. However, they do provide a route to liquidity  any time before maturity - by selling units in a recognised exchange.Redemptions can be made at;Investor Service Centres (ISCs)AMC officesOfficial Points of Acceptance of Transaction (OPAT)Through an authorised on-line platform.2",

        "question": "How do I get my returns in Mutual Funds?",
        "answer": "Like other asset classes, Mutual Funds returns are calculated by computing appreciation in the value of your investment over a period as compared to the initial investment made.Net Asset Value of Mutual Fundindicates its price and is used in calculating returns from yourMutual Fund investments. Return over a period is calculated as the difference in sale date NAV and purchase date NAV upon purchase date NAV and converted to percentage by multiplying the result by 100 . Any net dividend* or other income distribution by the fund during the holding period is also added to the capital appreciation while computing total returns.Capital appreciation inMutual Fundsis reflected by increase in NAV over time. This happens because NAV of a fund is derived from stock prices of companies included in the portfolio of the fund, and the prices fluctuate every day. Change in NAV of a fund over time contributes to the capital appreciation or loss in your holding. View the return performance of your investments in the account statement provided to you by the fund house. This statement captures both your transactions and the return on your investments.Note: *NAV of a Fund falls to the extent of dividend payout and statutory levy, if any.2",

        "question": "Know the Differences between PPF and Mutual Funds",
        "answer": "Two famous investment options are PPF (Public Provident Fund) and Mutual Funds. Both these investment choices have their own sets of differences.A public provident fund (PPF) is a long-term investment option, and it is backed by the Indian Government. PPF offers guaranteed returns to investors. This rate of interest is set by the Indian Government every quarter. It has a fixed investment period, with the minimum amount of investment per year as Rs. 500 and a maximum ofRs 1.5 lakh for each financial year. The principal amount, the interest earned and the maturity amount of PPF is completely tax-free. PPF has a lock-in period of15 years, in some casespremature withdrawals are possible only from the 7th year of making the investment.PPF is a low-risk investment option.Mutual funds - on the other hand, are professionally managed investment funds that pool money from different investors. A mutual fund invests in various classes, such as - stocks, bonds, and other securities. Mutual funds are set up and managed by AMCs (asset management companies), and the returns of the investment would depend on the performance of the underlying assets in which it is invested.PPF vs Mutual Fund - The Major Differences are:PPF offers a guaranteed return, while mutual fund returns are based on market movements.PPF has a lock-in period, while some Mutual Funds come with an exit load if the investor redeems the investments before a specific period. And there are sometypes of Mutual Fundswith alock-in period.PPF has a tax relief under Section 80C, and the interest on PPF is tax-free. Only ELSS Mutual funds have tax relief under Section 80C, However, returns from Mutual Funds attract capital gains tax.Returns in PPF are guaranteed, and they are backed by the government. Returns on Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are subject to market risks.However, the determination of which investment is more suitable relies on the investor's financial goals and objectives.DisclaimerMutual Fund investmentsare subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.2",

In many cases, the toll bridge company is allowed to charge the toll only for a certain number of years to recover the building costs. After that period is over, the company is not allowed to charge the passengers any toll.Investment in Mutual Fundsalso may be subject to some loads, but theyre different from the example of the tolls you just read. Until 2009, there used to be a charge levied at the time of entry into a Mutual Fund, but that doesnt exist anymore. Some schemes levy a charge on exiting the scheme, under certain conditions, which is called exit load.In most cases, even when an exit load is charged, it applies to exit within a certain period. If you stay invested longer than this period, noexit loadwould be applicable. In other words, most often, the exit load serves the purpose of discouraging an early exit from a scheme. Even on an exit load,SEBI, the mutual fund regulatory authority, has set a limit on the maximum exit load that can be charged.2",

        "question": "What is Mutual Fund Dividend?",
        "answer": "A Dividend is a distribution of earnings from a stock or aMutual Funds. InMutual Fund schemes, dividends are distributed when the fund has booked profits on the sale of securities in its portfolio.As per regulation, a fund can declare dividends only from the gains it has made from the sale of securities in the portfolio, or through any current income in the form of interest or dividends. Such gains are transferred to a Dividend Equalization Reserve, and at the discretion of the trustees, a dividend is declared.Dividends are declared as a percentage of the schemes face value (FV), and not the NAV. If FV per unit is Rs. 10 and dividend rate is 20%, every investor in the dividend option gets Rs.2 as dividend. However, theNAV, of the scheme falls by an equivalent amount after dividend declaration. Investors in the growth option are not entitled to the dividend, and the profit from the scheme is ploughed back into the scheme in this case. Thus,NAVof growth option increases in contrast to dividend option.With effect from 01 Apr 2020, dividends from mutual fund schemes have been made taxable in the hands of investors. Investors opting for dividend payout will now have to pay income tax on any dividend income received in a financial year at the highest income tax rate applicable to them. Investors opting for dividend reinvest will not have any implication on their taxes since they receive the profit in terms of additional units allotted in their folio.2",

It is a passive investment instrument that invests in gold bullion according to current gold prices. Therefore, in simple terms, Gold ETFs represent physical gold (in paper or dematerialized form).1 Unit of Gold ETF = 1 Gram of Gold.Gold ETFs are traded on the Indian stock exchanges - like any other stock of a company.

They are traded in the cash segment and could possibly be bought and sold continuously at market prices.The direct route to buy gold ETFs will require you to open a demat account through a stockbroker. After this, similar to purchasing shares, you can buy units of gold ETFs directly.The process is explained here in detail:Consult a stockbroker and open an online trading and demat account.On your trading portal, log into the account with the required credentials.Now, choose the gold ETFs you wish to purchase.Once you have purchased your desired amount of gold ETFs, you will get a confirmation message.In case an investor does not wish to invest in gold ETFs through the demat manner, they could also invest in gold mutual funds that indirectly invest in these ETFs.This means the investor is investing in gold mutual funds, whose underlying assets are gold ETFs.DisclaimerMutual Fund investmentsare subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.2",

        "answer": "Lets consider a Balanced Fund, which aims to provide growth and capital appreciation from the equity portion, and income and stability from the debt portion. This scheme still carries considerable risk, as the portion of equity could be as high as 60%. This is recommended only for investors with a healthy risk appetite and long term time horizon.The fund management team of such a scheme would ideally want only long term investors who share their conviction of staying invested for a long period, of a minimum of 3 years. Thus the fund may impose anexit loadof 1% for all redemptions done before 3 years. In such a case, the fund is not impacting liquidity directly, but is discouraging investors from exiting before a period of 3 years.The advantage for the scheme would stem from the fact that all investors are aligned to a longer time horizon. This would be a comforting factor for thefund manager, enabling him to pick securities with such a thought in mind. In the fund managers view such a strategy would enable betterfund performance, as there would be no short term investors and redemptions impacting a long term strategy.2",

        "answer": "When it comes to investing, people have differentfinancial goalsand risk appetites. The choice of your investments depends on your idea oflong-term and short-term goals.These factors deeply influence your investment choices and approach. A risk-o-meter serves as a tool to narrow your search for a suitable scheme.Understanding the new risk-o-meterThe risk-o-meter's innovative aspect lies in its risk grading approach. Unlike the previous risk-o-meter, which merely associated fund categories with varying risk grades, the newrisk-o-meterderives its risk assessments from the specific assets held within a fund. This means that the risk grade assigned to a particular fund scheme is based on that scheme's underlying assets and their concentration. This shift brings risk evaluation closer to reality as it considers the actual risks linked to the assets the fund owns.Selecting a suitable Mutual Funds schemeIn conjunction with your investment goals, risk appetite and time frame, the risk-o-meter's readings pinpoint investments that best match your criteria.For example, low-risk mutual funds like Overnight andArbitrage Fundsmay be suitable for investors prioritising capital preservation with minimal risk exposure in the short term.On the other hand, investors striving for maximum returns over the long term, even if it means risking their capital, align well withmutual funds schemesthat fall under the very high risk category.For more information, refer to the table provided on the left side.However, the key takeaway is not to select an investment based solely on its risk category. Instead, diving deeper and carefully evaluating the specific schemes within each category is crucial. Remember, not all funds within the same risk category are identical. They may have distinct strategies, holdings, and potential outcomes. Therefore, it's recommended to thoroughly analyse and choose the investment scheme that aligns most effectively with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

        "question": "Five reasons to start investing at an early age",
        "answer": "People often wait until later in life to start investing, even though it is the most effective way to safeguard their financial future. It is more common for first-time jobbers to upgrade their lifestyle than to plan for their future. In other words, they don't start investing until later in life.Even though it's never too late to start investing, there are many benefits to starting early. Besides, investing early in life can help young investors save more than investing later in life since they have fewer commitments at the beginning of their professional journey.Lets look at the five main reasons to start investing at a young age:Enjoy the Power of CompoundingThe most significant benefit of investing early is having additional time at your disposal. With the help of compounding, there is a better possibility of you being able to grow your investment over time. When your returns compound, the interest you earn on your investments is reinvested to generate more returns.Lets look at an example:Say you start a Systematic Investment Plan at the age of 25 when you get your first salary. You start with a SIP Amount of Rs 1000 at an average return of 10% per annum.At the age ofYouve Invested forInvested Amount (Rs)Earned Total Corpus of (Rs)3510 years1.2 lakh2.05 lakh4520 years2.4 lakh7.59 lakh5530 years3.6 lakh22.6 lakh6035 years4.2 lakh37.97 lakh*This is strictly as an example. The returns shown in the table are purely hypothetical and for illustration purpose only. Mutual Funds do not offer any assured rate of return.As you observe, even a Rs 1,000 investment may help you build substantial wealth over time.Here, it's important to note that the power of compounding also applies to lumpsum investments.Improve Your Risk-Taking AbilityThere is no doubt that risk has a direct correlation with reward. A long-term investment might help you manage your risk better. When you are young, you have the choice to invest in relatively risky avenues and decrease that risk as you age. As you grow older, you may find it harder to take high risks due to mounting responsibilities such as EMIs, childrens education, mortgage, etc. Investing early gives you a chance mitigating risks and building wealth without any financial stress.Makes It Easier to Manage LossesWhen you start early, you have time on your side. Losses could be because of ill-informed decisions, or market volatility. You can review your investment approach if required andmanage losses better.For example, in case of volatility in the markets, you may be better equipped to manage it with SIPs in mutual funds. When you start investing in Mutual Funds via SIPs, you are basically averaging out your investment cost by buying more units when the market is low and fewer units when the market is high. This is known as rupee cost averaging. If you start investing early, rupee cost averaging may help you manage your losses better.Make Informed DecisionsWhen you have more time on your hands, you can compare different investment options and even rebalance your portfolio whenever necessary, giving your investments time to mitigate the risks and enhance your returns. Besides, investing early helps you understand the nuances of the market with more time for trial and improvement and reduce your stress or fear of investing later in life.Fulfil An Early Retirement GoalReaching your retirement goal faster may be possible if you invest early and in the right investment avenues.Say you wish to reach a Rs 1-crore mark to retire early.Started investing at the age of 25Started investing at the age of 35SIP Amount (Rs)10,100SIP Amount (Rs)10,100Assumed Rate of Return12%Assumed Rate of Return12%Invested Amount (Rs)24.24 lakhInvested Amount (Rs)12.12 lakhFinal Corpusat the age of 45(Rs)1 croreFinal Corpusat the age of 45(Rs)23.5 lakh*This is strictly as an example. The returns shown in the table are purely hypothetical and for illustration purpose only. Mutual Funds do not offer any assured rate of return.As illustrated in the above example, investing early may help you reach your target amount faster and may even help you get an early retirement (or any other goal).ConclusionThere are many benefits to starting your investments early. As a young investor, you can take advantage of time spent in the market, that helps manage risk and build an emergency fund while reaching your financial goals faster. Thus, if you want to increase your chances of growing your investments, it's totally worthwhile to begin investing at a young age.DisclaimerMutual Fund investments are subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.2",

The advantage of investing early is that it gives the power of compounding and a chance for increasing the returns on your investments over the years.Note that the calculations mentioned in the article are for illustration purposes only.Importance of Savings and InvestmentThe financial practices of saving and investing have the potential to aid individuals in accomplishing their financial objectives and ensuring their future security.Saving allows you to accumulate funds for emergency situations, unexpected expenses, or future expenses such as buying a house or planning for retirement. Investing, on the other hand, allows you to put your money to work and generate returns over time, which can help build wealth and achieve long-term financial goals.By saving and investing, you can build a strong financial foundation, manage your finances effectively, and ensure a comfortable and secure future. It is important to start early andbe disciplined and consistent in these habits to reap the maximum benefits in the long run.FiveBenefits of Early InvestingThe advantages of early investing cannot be emphasised enough. Here are the top five reasons why you should start investing right now:Power of CompoundingThe earlier you start, the longer your investments have time to grow and compound. The power of compounding means that your returns generate more returns, and over time, even small investments can grow into a significant sum. For instance, even if you start investing Rs 500 a month in a SIP at a return of 12% p.a. for 30 years, you would have accumulated a corpus of Rs. 17.47 lakhs.More Time to Recover from Market FluctuationsInvesting early gives you more time to recover from market downturns or fluctuations and reach your financial goals. By starting early, you can afford to take more risks with your investments and still have time to recover if your investments dont perform well.Building Financial DisciplineInvesting early requires financial discipline and regular contributions to your investment portfolio. This habit can help you develop good financial habits and make it easier to achieve your financial goals. For instance, you can automate your investment habit by investing a small sum in SIPs every month.Better Financial SecurityEarly investing can help you achieve your financial goals and secure your future. By investing early, you can accumulate a significant amount of wealth over time, which can provide you with economic stability and peace of mind.Can Invest More With Fewer ResponsibilitiesWhen you start investing at a young age, you most likely havefewer responsibilities to take care of. This means you can allocate more money towards investing. As you grow older, you may have more financial responsibilities such as taking care of a family, paying for childrens education and healthcare needs, etc. This may not leave you with too muchroom to invest a higher amount.How to Start Investing?Investing in mutual funds is a great way to build wealth over the long term.

And Mutual Funds offer no guarantees. Given these limitations, is there any reason why someone should consider investing in Mutual Funds at all? Do they perform at all?Well, often there are versions of this question, asked by existing as well as potential Mutual Fundinvestors.Whereas the question might be similar in many cases, the origin of the question, the reason why such a question arose could be very different across different individuals.In one of the cases, the investor thought that the scheme he had invested in was not delivering investment returns as much as what he had expected. However, when probed, it was found that the investor was comparing two completely different schemes. This is like comparing apples with oranges  not the right approach.In another case, the investor had invested in a scheme, where the overall market was going through turmoil.

If the investor wants her capital to be safe and earn some reasonable fixed rate of return, irrespective ofinflationand taxes, then these may be good enough. However, if the investor wants to earn a positive return even after factoring inflation and taxes, then these may not be good enough.If an investor has a large enough corpus to start with and is really not worried about enhancing purchasing power, then RDs and FDs are safe and useful savings and income generating options. If an investor is more concerned about safety of principal and receipt of timely and predictable income, a FD may be ideal.2",

These returns and the period, both are decided by the issuer company and not by the depositor. Hence, if one wants to invest money for six years and a deposit is available for five years, the returns are known only for the first five years, but not for the entire six-year period. Thus, theinvestment returnsare known only in case of guaranteed return products, where the product maturity and investors time horizon are matching perfectly.In all other cases, the investment returns are unknown over the investors investment horizon.2",

In relatable terms, a certain amount of money buys you much less today, than it did years ago.Lets use an example to understand this better. Say you buy a grilled sandwich today for INR 100. The yearly inflation is 10%. Next year, the same sandwich will cost you INR 110. If your income also doesnt increase at least as per the inflation rate, youre unable to buy the sandwich or other such products, right?Inflation also tells investors how much of a return (%) their investments need to make for them to maintain their current/present standard of living. For example, if investment in X returned 4% and inflation was 5%, then the real return on investment would be -1% (5%-4%).Mutual Fundsgive you investment options which have the potential to give inflation beating returns!

        "answer": "If you are looking for a regular income inflow to manage your monthly household expenses, you should go forSystematic Withdrawal Plans(SWPs)in a Mutual Fund. All you need to do is invest a large lump sum amount in a suitable scheme and then start a SWP after a year, so that short-term capital gains tax doesnt apply. You can decide the payout amount and frequency as per your need and change them whenever you like.SWP is better than opting for dividend option in aMutual Fund schemebecause dividend payments are not guaranteed. They are subject to profits made by the companies in which theMutual Fundshas invested your money. If the market goes down and your fund makes losses in its portfolio, you may not receive any dividends. In case of SWP, even if the scheme is making losses it will still pay the amount opted for, by digging into the principal. Hence, you should have a lump sum amount to begin with in case of a SWP. You can set a withdrawal amount as a proportion (%) of your lump sum investment that will be slightly less than the returns you expect from the fund, so that your principal remains intact most of the times.2",

        "answer": "Mutual funds are commonly viewed as tools to build long term wealth, but there are types of mutual funds which are suited for short term goals also. Mutual funds for short-term goals are investment instruments designed to cater to financial objectives with a relatively brief time horizon.Characterised by their flexibility and liquidity, mutual funds for short-term goals aim to provide capital appreciation while minimising risk within the limited time available. These funds are structured to offer a balance between potential returns and underlying risk, aligning with the specific requirements of short-term financial objectives.These funds are well-suited for purposes like creating an emergency fund for unanticipated expenses, saving for a planned vacation or holiday, accumulating funds for a down payment on a home, financing a vehicle purchase, setting aside money for education expenses, covering wedding costs, and funding short-term home renovation projects, among other goals.Investors opting for mutual funds for short-term goals can potentially benefit fromprofessional fund management, diversified portfolios, and the ability to easily access their funds when needed.Severaltypes of mutual fundsare suitable for short-term investments, each with its own characteristics andrisk profiles. Some of the prominent categories of short-term mutual funds are:Liquid:Liquid or are mutual funds that invest in highly liquid and secure assets, such as short-term government securities and money market instruments. The primary objective is to provide investors with quick and easy access to their funds while maintaining a high level of safety and stability.Money Market Funds:Money Market Fundsare a category of mutual funds that mainly allocate investments to short-term, low-risk, and easily convertible securities like treasury bills, certificates of deposit, and commercial papers.Short-Term Debt Funds:Short-Term Debt Funds are mutual funds that largely allocate investments to fixed-income securities with brief maturities. Their objective is to generate returns primarily through interest income while mitigating the effects of fluctuations in interest rates.Short-Term Bond Funds:Short-Term Bond Funds are mutual funds that primarily invest in a diversified portfolio of short-term bonds. These funds aim to provide relatively higher returns than money market funds while maintaining a lower risk profile.Gilt Funds:Gilt Fundsare types of mutual funds that mainly invest in government securities or gilts. These funds offer a relatively low-risk investment option as government-backed securities typically have a high credit rating.Nevertheless, before engaging in short-term mutual funds, it is important for investors to properly evaluate their risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial objectives. Additionally, taking guidance from a financial advisor can assist in customizing the investment strategy according to individual needs and prevailing market conditions.DisclaimerMutual Fund investmentsare subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.2",

Fund managers invest in companies as per the funds investment objective and investors know what they are investing in. For instance, mid cap growth funds are supposed to have asset allocation to mid-cap segment with a growth-oriented investment style and their portfolio must reflect this. This helps investors compare funds with similar mandate. Portfolio balancing must be done regularly since market capitalisation changes with stock price movement on the exchange.Mid Cap Mutual Funds invest in the mid cap companies with higher growth potential, but don't exhibit risks associated with small caps since these companies have attained certain scale and stability. Mid Cap Mutual Funds offer higher returns than large caps without being risky like small cap funds.While choosing best mid cap Mutual Funds, look beyond the recent 3-5 year returns for consistency ofperformanceover longer periods and compare it with suitable benchmark returns.2",

Dont worry, you dont have to sit with mind-boggling spread-sheets and graphs.Anyone who has invested through an advisor or intermediary usually gets updates and review statements that track portfolio andscheme performance.

Growing your own veggies is a great way of eating healthy food, but effort is spent on seed selection, manuring, watering, pest control, etc. The latter option allows you to choose from a wide variety without the hard work.Similarly, you can create wealth by investing directly in shares of good companies or invest in them throughMutual Funds. Wealth can be created when we buy company stocks which use our money to grow their business, creating value for us.Direct investment in shares carries a relatively higher risk element. You need to pick stocks by researching the company and sector. Its a humongous task to choose few companies from thousands of them listed on the stock exchange. Once done, you need to keep a track of every stock's performance.In Mutual Funds, the stock picking is done by expertfund managers.

        "answer": "One must keep in mind that the regular expenses as well as the cost for various financial goals rise over a period. If theinflationis at 6% per year, the cost of a goal doubles over approximately 12 years. However, if the inflation is at 7%, the doubling happens roughly in ten years.Now when inflation is at 7% and you seek total safety of the principal amount, you would be able to invest in avenues that offer returns very close to the inflation. Adjust for taxes on the investment returns and your post-tax investment returns are lower than inflation.Let us look at some simple numbers:If inflation is 7% per year, and you can buy something for Rs. 100 now, you would need Rs. 107 to buy the same thing next year. A year later, the same item would cost Rs. 114.49, if the inflation remains at the same level.At the same time, if you had saved your money in a totally safe avenue that offered 6% per year after taxes, your Rs. 100 would grow to Rs. 106. This is Re. 1 less than the amount required above. After two years, the amount would have grown to Rs. 112.36, which is less than the cost of the item to be purchased.

        "answer": "Pension plans provide a guaranteed source of income in the form of annuity during retirement. However, they dont provide immediate liquidity for emergencies and offer limited choice in terms of diversification and investment styles. The premium paid towards a pension plan is tax deductible.Mutual Funds investmentsare not tax deductible unless you have invested in anELSS fundbut they offer you much more variety and flexibility in designing a retirement plan as per your need. If you are young, you can start SIPs in equity funds suiting your risk preference and continue the SIPs close to your retirement. You would have built a good corpus by then which can be transferred to short-term debt funds through STP(Systematic Transfer Plan) 2-3 yrs prior to retirement to reduce your risk.If you didnt plan well in advance for your retirement throughSIPbut are now thinking of it just before retirement, you can invest your lumpsum savings and opt forSWPto withdraw a specified amount every month post retirement.Pension plans have a conservative allocation and offer stable return while you need to choose a fund with suitable allocation in case of mutual funds. Since annuity income is taxed as per your income slab while you pay only capital gains tax on mutual fund withdrawals, Mutual Funds can be more tax-efficient.2",

        "question": "Choose the right SIP amount to reach your goal",
        "answer": "SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) is a disciplined manner of investing in mutual funds. In this plan, an investor can invest a fixed amount in mutual fund schemes (of their own choice) at a fixed interval (daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly). With anSIP, the investor gets to decide the amount and choose an SIP date offered by the asset management companies.You need to note that SIP is not a product of investment but a method of investing in mutual fund schemes, where the minimum SIP amount starts at Rs. 500. Whereas the other method to invest in a mutual fund scheme is through lumpsum, where you make an investment only once in bulk.Ideally, the first step is to determine the amount to invest as SIP. An individual needs to define his or her financial goals and put them in a priority order. Classify your goals into three broad buckets:long-term, medium-term, andshort-termto start with your investment.Long-term goals are the ones that are typically more than 5 years away. The objectives you want to achieve in 5 years or less can be classified as medium-term goals. Whereas short term are the ones you wish to achieve in a span of 6 months to 3 years. Once you have decided on your goals, you can ensure a goal-based plan.For instance, if you hold a long-term goal to build a corpus (education, child's marriage, buying a house, and more) that will occur after 15 years, know the current cost of this goal.So, now you have the current cost of this goal and the number of years remaining to reach it.

The minor must be the sole account holder represented by the parent/guardian. Joint holding is not allowed in a minors Mutual Fund folio. One should have aninvestmentgoal for the minor that needs to be achieved byinvesting in Mutual Fundslike say funding higher education.Once a child attains the age of 18 and becomes a major, the first thing you as a parent/guardian need to do is change the status of the sole account holder from Minor to Major else all transactions would be stopped in the account. The tax implications will now have to be borne by the sole account holder as applicable to any investor above the age of 18 years. Until the child is a minor, all incomes and gains from the child's portfolio is clubbed under the parent's income and the parent pays the applicable taxes. In the year the child turns major, he/she will be treated as a separate entity and will pay taxes for the number of months for which he/she is a major in that year.2",

        "answer": "Long-term investments aim to finance distant future goals, like college education, home, retirement, etc. Hence, choose a fund suitable for wealth creation. Long-term goals have a horizon beyond 10 years and equity-oriented schemes(>=65% equity allocation) are the one of the bestlong-term investmentoption. Equities have a higher potential for growth even though more volatile in the short-term as compared to hybrid anddebt funds.A well-diversifiedequity fundis more likely to offer stable growth over the long-term.Look for funds with higher risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio) i.e. funds offering higher returns for same level of risk.Expense ratios impact fund returns over long-term due to compounding effect. Choose a fund with lower expense ratio, meaning more funds are available for investment that can boost the funds return over long-term. Check thefund managerstrack record to see if he has been delivering good results. Look at the kind of funds he has managed and if his funds have consistently outperformed peers.You can also look at funds with higher beta for long-term investments as they tend to gain/lose more than the market, but markets usually move up. Hence a higher beta would mean your fund will gain more than the market in the long-run.2",

        "question": "How is ULIP different from Mutual Fund?",
        "answer": "A ULIP is Unit-Linked Insurance Plan. It is a life insurance policy with an investment component that is invested in various financial markets. The returns generated by the investment component determine the value of the policy. However, the sum assured on the death of the policy holder may not be a function of the market  the minimum sum assured may remain unaffected. In other words, aULIPis a hybrid product, combining investment and insurance.The investment component of ULIP is similar to a Mutual Fund.1. Both are managed investments.2. For both, a team of professionals manages the investments and the funds are invested in line with a stated objective.3. There would be units allotted to the investor on purchase and there would beNAVper unit declared periodically.Since ULIP is an insurance policy, failure to pay regular premium would result in termination of the risk cover.InMutual Funds,all the expenses are charged before calculation of the NAV, whereas in case of ULIP, some expenses are charged like mutual funds, whereas some others are charged by cancelling a small number of units from the investors accounts.Within one ULIP product, there could be more than one fund options and the investor is free to switch between these funds. However, some schemes put a restriction on the number of free switches in a year. In case of mutual fund, switches from one fund to another are allowed any number of times, but depending on the scheme from which one is exiting, there may or may not beexit loads.2",

The main purpose of a passbook is to keep track of all transactions with a bank: deposit, withdrawals, credit of interest etc. In aMutual Fund schemetoo, similar transactions could be there: purchase, redemptions, switches, reinvestment of dividend etc. In a Mutual Fund scheme, such transactions are captured in the account statement.An account statement is issued after the first investment in a scheme is made. The account statement would reflect all relevant details: Investor name, address, details of joint holding, amount invested,NAVdetails, units allotted etc. Every time a new transaction is made, the account statement would be updated and a copy is mailed to the investor. In this digital era, many investors opt for e-statements, which is more convenient way to read, access and store information.Investors can at any time access and avail a duplicate account statement by contacting the Asset Management Companies (AMC) or its Registrar.

The same goes with SIPs.Systematic Investment Plans(SIPs) are a disciplined way of investing in Mutual Funds that offer you twin benefits of managing market fluctuations through rupee cost averaging andpower of compoundingover long-term. SIPs have become a popular way ofinvesting in Mutual Fundsas they allow small and regular investments over many years. Does this mean youll be stuck forever with theinitial SIP amountyou started with? The answer is NO.Suppose you started with INR 3000 p.m. inEquity Mutual Fundand continued investing for two years. If you want to commit more money towards this SIP, go for SIP top-up that lets you automatically increase the SIP amount by a pre-defined percentage (say 50%) or amount (say INR 1500) at regular intervals/every year. While you cant increase your SIP amounts automatically every month, you can increase it at specific intervals like quarterly or annually through top-ups.

An investor can buy as many units as she wishes without any restriction through the exchange.In the simple terms, ETFs are funds that track indexes such as CNX Nifty or BSE Sensex, etc. When you buy shares/units of an ETF, you are buying shares/units of a portfolio that tracks the yield and return of its native index. The main difference between ETFs and other types ofindex fundsis that ETFs don't try to outperform their corresponding index, but simply replicate the performance of the Index.

This will help them earn a regular monthly income from such investments.Debt fundsare relatively safer than equity funds as they invest inbonds issued by banks, companies, government bodies and money market instruments (bank CDs,T-bills, Commercial Papers).SWP in debt funds provides tax efficient returns as compared to bank FDs. Income from FDs/pension plans are taxed at higher effective rates compared to withdrawals under SWP.

        "question": "What is power of compounding?",
        "answer": "To many, the power of compounding seems like a difficult topic. But it is not so. Well help you understand this in a simple manner.Let us assume that someone invested \u20b9. 10,000 @ 8% p.a. The interest for the year would be \u20b9.800. However, when the interest is reinvested in the same investment, the earning next year would accrue on original investment of Rs. 10,000 as well as on the additional investment of \u20b9.800. This means, the earning for the second year would be \u20b9. 864. As the years pass, the interest for the year keeps increasing since there is additional investment each year.How much money would be accumulated after a certain time period if the returns are reinvested? Let us see.Investment:\u20b9.. 1, 00,000Rate of return: 8% p.a.The above table shows some interesting pattern. As the investment is held for longer periods, the earning keeps growing faster. While the earning in the first 5 years was \u20b9.. 0.47 lacs, the same for the next 5-year period was \u20b9.. 0.69 lacs (\u20b9.. 2.16 lacs  \u20b9.. 1.47 lacs). The earning in the 21styear  a single year  was \u20b9.. 0.37 lacs.As the time goes, the earnings do not multiply, but grow exponentially.Essentially, compounding is the process of earning income on your principal investment plus the income earned  the income also starts to earn as the same is reinvested.*Please note that these calculations are for illustrations only and do not represent actual returns. Mutual Funds do not have a fixed rate of return and it is not possible to predict the rate of return.2",

His job is to first ensure he does not lose the wicket, and then focus on scoring runs.While saving is a must for investing, it is important to save ones wicket in order to be able to score later. One can save the wicket by playing defensive cricket and avoiding all sorts of shots. But that would result in a very low score. He would need to hit some boundaries by taking certain risks like lofted shots or drives between fielders or cuts and nudges.Similarly, in order to accumulate large sums to meet onesfinancial goals, in order to beatinflation, one must take certain investment risks. Investing is all about taking calculated risks and managing the same, not avoiding the risks altogether.At the same time, in the cricket analogy, in order to stay at the crease as well as score runs, one must take calculated risks and not play rash shots. Taking unnecessary risks is a bad strategy.So while saving is necessary, investing is very important to achieve long term goals.",

        "question": "Do Indian Mutual Funds invest only in India?",
        "answer": "While most Indian Mutual Funds invest only in India, there are quite a few schemes that invest in overseas securities.AllMutual Fund schemesneed to getSecurities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)approval before offering units to investors in India. SEBI gives an approval after scrutinising the Scheme Information Document (SID), which clearly spells out the schemes investment objectives, type of securities to be invested in, countries & regions, and risks unique to each security.There are in fact two ways for a scheme to get such exposure to foreign securities. Schemes may either buy such securities listed or traded in overseas exchanges, or they may invest in other overseas Mutual Fund schemes that have such securities in their portfolio after obtaining separate SEBI approval for investment in foreign securities. Either way, the scheme has foreign flavour in the portfolio.Even after investment in overseas securities, Indian Mutual Funds have to provide dailyNet Asset Values, ensure portfolio disclosure, provide liquidity, etc. In short they have to comply with all SEBI regulations. Such schemes should have a dedicated separatefund managerfor the investments in foreign securities component only.2",

        "answer": "Once youinvest in a Mutual Fundscheme, you will get an account statement with details like the date of the transaction, the amount invested, and the price at which the units are bought and the number of units allotted to you.You can do multiple transactions in the same account, wherein the statement will keep getting updated. A typical account statement will list out the last few (10 in most cases) transactions  whether purchase or redemption; dividends, if any; or even non-commercial transactions. The account statement would also give you a count of your latest unit balance, theNAVof a recent date and the current value of your investments.If you lose one statement, you can always get another one without hassles. Loss of account statement would not prevent you from future transactions, including taking your money out of the account.2",

        "question": "What is Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)?",
        "answer": "Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)is an investment route offered by Mutual Funds wherein one can invest a fixed amount in aMutual Fund schemeat regular intervals say once a month or once a quarter, instead of making a lump-sum investment. The installment amount could be as little asINR 500 a monthand is similar to a recurring deposit. Its convenient as you can give your bank standing instructions to debit the amount every month.SIPhas been gaining popularity among Indian MF investors, as it helps in investing in a disciplined manner without worrying about market volatility and timing the market. Systematic Investment Plans offered byMutual Fundsare easily the best way to enter the world of investments for the long term. It is very important toinvest for the long-term, which means that you should start investing early, in order to maximize the end returns. So your mantra should be - Start Early, Invest Regularly to get the best out of your investments.How Does a SIP Work?SIPs operate on the principle of Rupee Cost Averaging, which means that when the market is low, you buy more units, and when the market is up, you buy less units while investing the same amount of money every time. In this manner, you average out the cost of acquisition and benefit from the market's ups and downs without the stress of timing. However, the investments you make in mutual funds through the SIP manner would also be subject to market volatility and risks.Lets understand how an SIP investment works with an example.Monthly SIP investment: \u20b91,000Investment period: 5 monthsLet's assume the market price of the mutual fund units fluctuates over these 5 months.MonthInvestment (\u20b9)Price Per Unit (\u20b9)Units PurchasedMonth 11,0005020Month 21,0004025Month 31,0002050Month 41,0002540Month 51,0005020Total5,000155 unitsTherefore, you can see that -Total Investment: \u20b95,000Total Units Purchased: 20 + 25 + 50 + 40 + 20 = 155 units.Average Cost per Unit: \u20b95,000 / 155 units \u2248 \u20b932.26 per unit.How Mutual Fund SIP Investments Can Benefit YouInvesting in Mutual Fund SIPs offers various benefits, and the list of the benefits is given below:1. Disciplined Approach to Investing:SIPs tend to promote regular and disciplined investing. Through a fixed amount regularly, investors can build the habit of investing.2. Compounding Benefits:The power of compounding works best when the investments are made for a long period of time, on a regular basis. SIPs let investors benefit from compounding returns, as the returns generated are reinvested.3. Rupee Cost Averaging:SIPs help investors with rupee cost averaging. Rupee cost averaging means that when the market is down, you will buy more units, and when the market is up, you will buy fewer units with SIPs. This helps to spread the effect of market movements on the investments.4. Convenience:SIPs are a more convenient form of investment. You can automate SIPs to a mutual fund scheme through a bank mandate and ensure that a fixed amount is deducted from your bank account and invested in the chosen mutual fund scheme.5. Lower Investment Capital:SIPs come up as affordable investments since you can start investing with a small amount, which makes it affordable. This can mainly be useful for young investors, or those with limited funds to begin investing.6. SIPs Offer Flexibility:SIPs offer flexibility in terms of the amount of SIP you want to invest and the frequency of investment, such as monthly, quarterly, and more. You could also increase or decrease your SIP amount according to your financial situation.7. SIPs Offer Diversification:Investing through SIPs in mutual fund schemes offer diversification across different asset classes based on the kind of mutual fund it is - such as, sectors, geographies, and more.8. Professional Managed Investment:Mutual fund schemes are managed by professional fund managers, and they have expertise to analyze and select the best investment opportunities, providing investors with more possibilities of achieving their financial goals.9. Passively Managed Funds:Passively managed mutual funds are investment funds that aim to replicate the performance of a specific market index or benchmark rather than trying to outperform it. The primary goal of these funds is to mirror the returns of the chosen index as closely as possible, and investors can invest in these funds through SIP method too.Types of Mutual Fund SIPsHere are the main types of Mutual Fund SIPs:1. Regular SIP:In this SIP, you will invest a fixed amount at regular intervals.2. Flexible SIP:This SIP allows investors to change the investment amount or skip investments at their convenience.3. Perpetual SIP: Regular SIPs usually have an end date, but perpetual SIPs continue until the investor decides to stop them.4. Trigger SIP:This allows you to set certain triggers for investments, such as a particular date,NAVlevel, or index level.5. Multi SIP:You can use a single SIP to invest in multiple mutual fund schemes.6. Step-up SIP:This form of SIP is like a top-up SIP, but the increase in investment amount is predefined and occurs at regular intervals.How to Invest in Mutual Funds through SIP?You can invest in Mutual funds through the SIP modein the following manner:Select a mutual fund scheme based on your investment goals, investment horizon and risk tolerance.Complete theKYCneeded and other requisites on the platform.Submit the necessary documents requested by the platform/Mutual Fund/MFD for investment.Set up your SIP with the amount you want to invest on a regular basis, choose the frequency of your investments, and the duration for which you want to continue the SIP.Provide standing instructions or an Electronic Clearing Service Mandate to your bank to debit the specific amount from your bank account on the selected dates. On the selected date, the amount will automatically be debited from your accountand invested in the mutual fund scheme.The mutual fund will allocate units to your account according to the fund's Net Asset Value.Notes:You can increase or decrease your SIP amount, or even stop or pause the SIP at any time without any penalties. You can even estimate your SIP investment returns after a particular period of time with the use of a SIP calculator, to forecast your next move in the investment. Can withdraw the amount invested subject to exit load and tax implications.After your SIP has begun, the only thing you need to do is monitor and review the performance of your investments regularly.ConclusionYou can benefit from SIP investing in various ways, such as flexibility, affordability, and more.Each type of SIP offers different benefits, and comes with different sets of features, management fees, tax implications and this will allow you to choose an SIP that suits your needs the best.DisclaimerMutual Fund investments are subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.2",

        "answer": "Invest in SIPor a one-time investment (lumpsum)? Choosing one depends on your familiarity withMutual Funds, the fund you want to invest in and your goal. If you want to invest regularly to accumulate sufficient capital for a goal, invest in a suitable equity scheme through SIP. Like, if you want to save from your monthly income and put it in an option where you can grow your money significantly so that in the long run itll be sufficient tofund your childs higher education, SIP is the answer. Seek help from a financial expert if needed.If you have surplus cash now, like - bonus, proceeds from property sale or retirement corpus, but unsure how to use it, go for lumpsum investment in a debt or liquid fund. SIPs are advisable for investing in equity-oriented schemes while lumpsums are better suited fordebt funds. If you are new toinvesting in Mutual Funds, SIPs are meant for you. SIPs need sufficiently long-time horizons to prove beneficial. You may invest in lumpsum if the market has been following an upward trend and you think itll continue for long. SIPs are best suited for a widely fluctuating market phase.2",

It is next to impossible to know how the market will behave, and which scheme and manager would be able to capitalize the most during a said period.What is good in one situation may not be good in another.

        "answer": "Some peopleinvest in Mutual Fundsfor a regular income, and they usually look at options of getting a dividend. Thus many schemes, especially debt oriented schemes, have monthly or quarterly dividend options. It is important to note that dividends are distributed from the profits or gains made by the scheme and are in no way guaranteed every month. Though the fund house endeavors to give consistent dividends, the distributable surplus is determined by market movements andfund performance.There is another method to get a monthly income: using theSystematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP). Here, you need to invest in the growth plan of a scheme and specify a certain fixed amount required as a monthly payout. Then on a designated date, units amounting to that fixed amount would be redeemed. For example, an investor could invest Rs. 10 lacs and request that Rs. 10,000 be paid on the 1stof every month. Then, units worth Rs. 10,000 would be redeemed on the 1stof every month.It is important to note that the tax treatment for both, dividend and SWPs, vary, and investors need to plan accordingly.*Monthly Income is not assured and should not be construed as guarantee of future returns.2",

        "question": "What are the various type of debt funds?",
        "answer": "Debt fundsare for investors who seek safety of capital or regular income from investment and/or want to park money for short periods.But debt funds are of various types.Like in banks, you can open a savings account, where you can put and remove money whenever you want. However, it doesnt make sense to keep money idle, if you are not likely to use it for some time. You may, in such a case, open a fixed deposit  where the money is locked for a certain period allowing you to earn a higher rate of interest. You may also opt for arecurring deposit, wherein you keep investing a fixed amount every month for a pre-defined period of time. All these products help you with different requirements.Similarly, amongMutual Fundstoo there are variants available in the debt fund category to fulfill various needs of investors, like Liquid Funds, Income Funds, Government Securities and Fixed Maturity Plans.An investor would be advised to select schemes based on ones unique requirements.2",

        "answer": "AllMutual Fund Schemesoffer two plans- Direct and Regular. In a Direct Plan, an investor has to invest directly with the AMC, with no distributor to facilitate the transaction. In a Regular Plan, the investor invests through an intermediary such as distributor, broker or banker who is paid a distribution fee by the AMC, which is charged to the plan.Therefore, the direct plan has a lower expense ratio as there is no distribution fee involved, while the regular plan has a slightly higher expense ratio to account for the commission paid to a distributor to facilitate the transaction.Managing aMF schemeentails costs and expenses, like fund management expenses, sales and distribution expenses, custodian and registrar fees etc. All such expenses are covered by the expense ratio of the fund. Such expenses are within the limits prescribed by the regulator SEBI.Thus if an investor chooses to invest directly through the Direct Plan, she may get marginally higher return on account of savings in expenses, but she would not be able to avail of distribution and related services of an intermediary.",

Whereas certain other schemes, known as hybrid funds, invest in more than one asset categories, e.g. some invest in equity and debt both. Some may also invest in gold apart from equity and debt.In cricket, we see batting all-rounders as well as bowling all-rounders depending on the skill they are better at. Similarly, there areMutual Fund schemesthat invest heavily in one asset category as compared to another.The oldest category, the balanced fund category, invests in equity and debt. The allocation to equity is normally higher (over 65%) and the rest is in debt.The other popular category known as MIP or the monthly income plan endeavours to provide monthly (or regular) income to investors. However, there is no guarantee of regular income. These schemes invest predominantly in debt securities so that regular income can be generated. A small portion is invested in equity to enhance returns over the years.Another variation of the hybrid scheme invests in equity, debt and gold, to take advantage of three different asset classes in one portfolio.An investor has an option of buying different equity or debt or gold fund schemes to create a hybrid portfolio or alternately buy ahybrid fund.2",

In a Passive Fund, the fund manager builds a portfolio that mirrors a popular market index, say Sensex or Nifty Fifty.Furthermore, Equity Funds can also be divided as per Market Capitalisation, i.e. how much the capital market values an entire companys equity. There can beLarge Cap,Mid Cap, Small or Micro Cap Funds.Also there can be a further classification as Diversified or Sectoral / Thematic. In the former, the scheme invests in stocks across the entire market spectrum, while in the latter it is restricted to only a particular sector or theme, say, Infotech or Infrastructure.Thus, an equity fund essentially invests in company shares, and aims to provide the benefit of professional management and diversification to ordinary investors.",

Debt funds are also referred to asFixed Income Fundsor Bond Funds.A few major advantages of investing in debt funds are low cost structure, relatively stable returns, relatively high liquidity and reasonable safety.Debt funds are ideal for investors who aim for regular income, but are risk-averse. Debt funds are less volatile and, hence, are less risky than equity funds. If you have been saving in traditional fixed income products like Bank Deposits, and looking for steady returns with low volatility, debt Mutual Funds could be a better option, as they help you achieve yourfinancial goalsin a more tax efficient manner and therefore earn better returns.In terms of operation, debt funds are not entirely different from otherMutual Fund schemes.

So when you eat food, youve got to maintain balance. Food serves certain basic needs of the body  they offer vital nutrients: you need energy, you need stamina, you need strength, you need good eye sight  you get these from the vital nutrients  the fats, carbs, proteins, vitamins, etc. that food provides. At the same time, no single food item provides everything and hence you need varieties of food items in your daily meals.In a similar manner, there are different Mutual Fund schemes for different purposes  to fulfill different needs of different investors.Let us look at the basic requirements out of investments. An investor mainly needs a combination of four things: (1) safety of capital, (2) regular income, (3) liquidity, (4) growth of capital invested.There areMutual Fund schemesavailable to serve these needs.

For instance, you pay a parking fee for the time you use the parking space. When you send a courier, you pay for the weight of the courier and the distance it needs to travel to reach the recipient. When you borrow money from someone, the lender charges you a fee for the amount and time you borrow. This fee expressed as a percentage of the principal amount borrowed, is the Interest Rate usually specified for a year.Companies, banks and government bodies raisedebt fundsfrom the public and deploy this capital in some aspects of their business. They pay a fee for such borrowings. They issue bonds to raise money from the public and in return pay an interest rate to the bond holders i.e. the fee, bond holders need as compensation for investing their money. A bank pays you an interest on your savings or fixed deposits. Similarly, companies pay an interest when they issue bonds. WhenMutual Fundsbuy these bonds for their portfolio, they earn interest income. Prices of bonds are inversely related to interest rates i.e. they always move in opposite directions.2",

WhileGold ETFsoffer returns directly linked to the performance of the metal, Gold Funds offer returns linked to the performance of the gold industry.Gold Mutual Funds, managed byfund managersbeing actively managed, have the potential to offer higher return as compared to Gold ETFs that mimic a market index. Since ETFs replicate an index, Gold ETFs have lower expense ratio than Gold Fund. Gold ETFs track the price movement of the physical metal more precisely than Gold Mutual Funds. Since ETFs are listed on an exchange, they offer high liquidity. You can buy or sell your holdings at any time during the day at the real-time price of gold. Thus, Gold ETFs are a good alternative to owning physical gold,. Gold Funds offer a good opportunity to invest in the gold industry for the long-term throughSIP.2",

While mutual funds have the flexibility to choose stocks in order to generate returns in line with their stated investment objective, Index Funds track a specific index. Hence Index Funds invest in the same stocks that are included in the index. Since Index Funds dont take active decision in choosing stocks for their portfolio, they are called passively managed funds.Index Fundstend to generate average market return while actively managed mutual funds aim to generate alpha (return in excess of their benchmark return) by taking active calls on stock selection for their portfolio. The higher expected return comes at the cost of higher risk as compared to Index Funds that simply follow an index and generate return is in sync with their index.Actively managed funds tend to have higher management fees and hence higher expense ratio as theyve to pay hefty fees to hirefund managers. These funds also incur significant transaction cost due to active trading while Index Funds have fewer transactions in their portfolio. This also make Index Funds more tax-efficient than Mutual Funds. Actively managedMutual Fundsgenerate capital gains when they sell securities in the portfolio to book profit.

Once these responsibilities have been taken care of, we start looking at how much is left for the retired life thats around the corner. Thats when people start thinking of investing their lifes savings in something that can give fast returns in a short period before the retired phase begins.

        "question": "What is the difference between Multi Cap and Flexi Cap Funds?",
        "answer": "If you have been wondering what are multi cap and flexi cap funds, you can refer to SEBIsproduct categorization circularissued in Oct 2017 that came into effect in June 2018. This circular allowed multicap funds to invest 65% of their assets in equity and equity related instruments across large cap, mid cap and small cap stocks. In Sept 2020,SEBImandated multicap funds to maintain an exposure of atleast 25% each in large cap, mid cap and small cap stocks with the aim of providing greater diversification to multi cap fund investors. However, this limits the fund managers ability to leverage opportunities based on his/her outlook because at times it may be necessary to underweigh a particular segment that is expected to do poorly which would mean flouting the minimum 25% allocation mandate.Hence in Nov 2020, SEBI introduced Flexi Cap Funds which are similar toMulti Cap Fundsbut follow a flexible investment mandate. The key difference between multicap and flexicap fund is the flexibility the latter has in changing allocation between large caps, mid caps and small caps while ensuring 65% of its assets are allocated to equity and equity related instruments. For instance, if thefund managerfeels a need to reduce exposure to small caps during economic uncertainty, he/she can reduce the allocation to zero and increase the allocation to large caps/mid caps. But a multi cap fund cant manage its portfolio in such a dynamic manner.Investors who find comfort in remaining invested across market capitalizations irrespective of the market cycles with a fixed allocation in small cap, mid cap and large cap companies, can choose Multi cap funds. Those who prefer a flexible investment strategy that can increase/decrease exposure across market caps depending on the market outlook can opt for Flexi cap funds.2",

        "question": "What is Lock-in Period in Mutual Funds?",
        "answer": "There are a few type of mutual funds that impose a lock-in period on your investment. These include equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS), Fixed Maturity Plans (FMP) in debt funds and closed ended mutual funds. A lock-in period refers to the minimum duration for which investors must hold their investment. Investors cannot redeem or sell mutual fund units in that period.Lock-in periods can vary depending on the type of mutual fund scheme. For instance, Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS) are a tax-saver mutual fund with a lock-in period of three years. That means you cannot sell or redeem their units before the completion of three years from the date of investment. Similarly, certain closed-ended mutual funds may have a lock-in period specified in the schemes offer document. Besides, returns generated from investments owned for over three years are categorizedas Long-TermCapital Gains (LTCG). The tax rate for LTCG is less than the rate applied to regular income (dependent on the individual's taxable earnings). Hence, lock-in period for more than three years may prove to be beneficial.However, most open-ended mutual funds do not have a lock-in period. You can buy and sell their units at any time.For fixed maturity plans in debt funds, you need to hold onto your investment until the lock-in period, which is for a fixed term. After that period, you can redeem your units. The lock-in is not for tax planning but to realizethe yield on the underlying debt assets, which should be held until maturity.Lock-in periods are usually implemented to discourage short-term trading and speculation. It helps you develop the habit of investing for the long term.Importance of Lock-In Period1. Encourages you to stay invested for long-term2. Prevents impulsive exits during market fall3. Allows fund managers to focus on performance4.  Minimizesvolatility in returnsDepending on the type of fund after the lock-in period, instead of selling your investment immediately, evaluate it. If its meeting your expectations, you can choose to hold on to it or even invest further.By aligning mutual fund schemes with your long-term financial goals and adopting a disciplined approach, you can leverage the power of compounding to achieve them.DisclaimerMutual Fund investments are subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.2",

        "question": "What is dividend distribution tax?",
        "answer": "Dividends are paid from the profit made byMutual Fund schemespurely out of investment activities pertaining to the schemes portfolio and are at the discretion of the trustee. If the scheme makes a loss in a falling market, the trustees may decide to forgo dividend payout announcement. Since dividend is a profit or income, it is considered taxable and the tax applicable on dividends is called Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT). Earlier dividends were taxable at source i.e the scheme had to pay DDT before distributing it to investors. This obviously reduced the amount of dividend payout, but it was tax-free in the hands of investors.With effect from Apr 01, 2020, DDT has been abolished andmutual fund dividendshave been made taxable in the hands of investors. Now dividend income will be considered as income from other sources and investors will have to pay tax on it as per their individual tax slabs. Hence the benefit or loss owing to mutual fund dividend tax as compared to the previous regime of DDT tax will depend on the investors tax slab.Earlier, all investors received the dividend payout after a uniform Dividend Distribution Tax rate was deducted by the scheme. DDT had an equal impact on all investors because it reduced the distributable surplus of the scheme with the application of a uniform tax rate depending on the type of scheme. Thats no more the case now. While investors will receive dividends in proportion to their investments, an investor in a higher tax slab will end up paying higher tax on the dividends received as compared to someone in a lower tax bracket.Removal of DDT has made it a level playing field for both Growth and Dividend options under a scheme. Hence investors will now have to weigh the benefits of opting for a dividend option in terms of effective tax rate (including cess and surcharge) applicable to them and the need for dividend income.2",

You cantcompare performance of schemesbelonging to different categories. Schemes from the same category having similar investment objective, asset allocation, and same benchmark index must be compared. Just like you cant compare an SUV with a sedan because of the way both are designed to suit different needs, schemes designed for different investment objectives may be carrying different risk levels. But when you compare two schemes following the same benchmark it is like comparing the performance of two cars designed with the same engine system. It is fine to compare two bluechip funds or two small cap funds, but you shouldnt compare the performance of a bluechip fund to that of a small cap fund even if both are equity schemes.

        "answer": "Just like a school report card shows the score of a child in various exams held during the academic year across different subjects that are taught by different teachers, a Consolidated Account Statement(CAS) is a physical statement that captures all financial transactions done by an investor across differentMutual Fundsduring a month. If you have invested in three different funds, all the financial transactions like purchase, redemption, switches,SIPs/STPs/SWPs, dividend payouts/reinvestment of dividends are captured.The CAS also captures opening and closing balances of the various portfolios linked to a PAN. Non-financial transactions like changes to bank detail, address, nominees etc are however not captured in a CAS. A CAS not only captures monthly financial transactions across different fund houses, it also captures transaction in other securities held in Demat mode. This means even stock related transactions are captured in a CAS.Thus, CAS is truly a consolidated statement of all your financial investment related transactions. The CAS is generated monthly and is mailed to the investors by the 10th day of the following month. CAS is generated for unique PAN holders and hence it captures all financial transactions associated with a particular PAN.

        "question": "Why is nomination important in Mutual Funds and what is the process for it?",
        "answer": "You may have many goals and dreams in life. You invest your hard-earned money to fulfil those dreams and aspirations. You may also invest to help your loved ones achieve their dreamsboth during your life and in your absence.Everyone has certain goals in life, some dreams to achieve. Every goal also needs some planning and not to forget, finance. One invests their hard-earned money to fulfil those dreams and aspirations, their own as well as their near and dear ones.Life can be full of surprises. One would expect that after his/her demise, logically, youre their investments would pass on automatically to their partner, or children. But in real life, it may not be an easy or seamless process. Lets take the example of Rajiv Gupta to understand why.Rajiv Gupta had created four different portfolios, one for his goals, one for his wifes financial security, and the remaining to fund his childrens education. HisMutual Fund SIPswere also planned accordingly.Luckily, Rajiv Gupta was wise enough to assign a nominee to each of his portfolios. With one simple step, i.e. nomination, Rajiv ensured that the portfolios will be transferred to the rightful nominee and his purpose is fulfilled in case of any eventuality.Mutual Funds NominationsNomination is a simpler and inexpensive way to make things easy for ones near and dear ones to claim the money in their mutual fund folio, demat account or bank account expeditiously, through minimal paper after their death.A nomination in respect of the Units does not create an interest in the property after the death of the Unit holder. The rights in the Units will vest in the nominee(s) only upon the death of all Unit Holders. It may be noted that a nominee may not necessarily acquire any title or beneficial interest in the property by virtue of this nomination. The nominee(s) shall receive the Units only as an agent and trustee for the legal heirs or legatees as the case may be.Is Nomination mandatory for Mutual Funds?Nomination is mandatory for MF investors. With effect from October 1, 2022, new investors subscribing to Mutual Fund units would have to compulsorily assign a nominee or fill a declaration form to opt out of nomination. Existing investors too would have to either assign a nominee in their older investments or opt out of nomination by March 31, 2023. This is applicable irrespective of whether the investment is held individually or jointly.How to add nominees to Mutual Funds investments?You can add or update the nominees in your Mutual Fund holding by submitting a physical request at the nearest AMC/RTA branch. Alternatively, it can also be done online on the AMC/RTA website or on mfcentral.com. Login to your account and choose the folio under which you want to add/update nominees. Fill in the nominee details like name and address along with the percentage of ownership each nominee will get. If no percentage is specified, each nominee will be eligible for an equal percentage. You will then receive an OTP as part of the two-factor authentication to verify the nominee updation request. Alternatively, the digital form can be signed using the e-Sign facility.If you are not comfortable online, you can visit the nearest branch or Investor Service Center, of the Fund House to add/update nominee details in your folio. All you need to do is submit a written application or fill up the relevant section of the Common Application Form. You will need to specify the account/folio where you need to add/update nominees and the names of the nominees. In case of more than one nominee in an account/folio, you need to specify the percentage allocation of your investments between all the nominees. Also, in case of joint holding, all the unit holders will have to sign the form with their wet signatures.Last wordsRemember, if an investor doesnt specify a nominee in his/her account or choose to opt out of nomination, the investments can only be claimed by the legal heir(s) of the investor after proving their legal heirship. This, however, can be a long-run process. Hence, it is advisable to have nominee/s in all yourmutual fund investmentsto enable a smooth transfer of assets in case of an unfortunate event.So get all your Mutual Fund investment accounts updated with Nominee details and save your family from the hassle of proving their legal heirship to claim your investments in case of an unfortunate event.2",

        "answer": "Many people are interestedininvestingin Mutual Funds for their potential to generate better return than most other asset classes over the long-term, but they just dont know where to begin. SinceMutual Fundsare risky, most prospects are skeptical of putting in their hard-earned savings into it. They are constantly researching to find which fund should they invest in that would give them thebenefits of Mutual Fundswithout the risk. Since there are no free lunches, we dont have a zero-risk fund that gives us returns like otherMutualFunds. Butovernight fundscome close to this.These funds invest in securities maturing the next day. Hence, they are highly liquid and carry minimal risk. But it is difficult to generate themuch requiredreturn you need for your portfolio to serve you in the long-term through these funds. If trying outMutualFunds in a small scale before committing your life savings into it is what you are looking for, then Overnight Funds are the answer. But use these funds only if you want to park a large sum of money for a short while or to get comfortable with Mutual Funds as an investment option.

        "question": "Cost of delay/impact of compounding in Mutual Funds",
        "answer": "When you invest in a mutual fund over a long period of time, the returns you earn have acompounding effect.However, if you delay your investments by a few years, youll lose out on the same. This compounding effect will widen the difference between what you will accumulate versus what you could have accumulated had you started investing a few years earlier. Check outmutualfundssahihai.com/en/what-age-should-one-start-investingto understand this better.The compounding effect shows its magic over the long term because the longer you stay invested, the more time your money gets to compound. Thepower of compoundingis like a magnifying glass whose magnifying power grows exponentially over time. If you delay your investments, whether through SIP or in lumpsum, and invest a higher amount, you will still not be able to catch up with someone who started investing say five years before you. In case of aSIPhe/she may be investing half the amount you are investing but your investments will still lag behind. Even with a lumpsum investment, delay of few years would mean your accumulated wealth will be less than someone who invested in lumpsum few years before you. Thats a huge cost to pay for delaying your investment decision.If you start investing early inMutual Funds, even if your investment amount is small, you are likely to accumulate much higher wealth over few decades compared to if you start investing a higher amount by say 10 years later. Its just like the hare and the tortoise story wherein slow and steady investments initiated early in life will help you reach your goal comfortably instead of starting late even though you are willing to invest more.2",

        "question": "What are Unregulated Deposit Schemes?",
        "answer": "There have been many instances wherein gullible investors have been lured into investment schemes that promise higher returns than what is available in the market without much downside risk. Such unregulated investment schemes are called Ponzi schemes and have very high risks. Unregulated deposit schemes are deposit schemes undertaken by individuals, groups of individuals, or a company for business purpose which are not registered under any of the nine regulatory authorities responsible for overseeing all kinds of deposit schemes in India. These schemes usually promise very high returns with little or no risk.Thousands of investors have lost their hard-earned money in many such unregulated deposit schemes, and this compelled the Government to pass theBanning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Act in 2019.This Act lists down regulated deposit schemes and also includes investment options likeMutual Fundsand Portfolio Management Services (PMS) which are not conventionally considered as deposit schemes.When you come across an investment option that looks very promising with very little risk involved, remember that risk and return always go together. There is no free lunch in the world and a higher return will always be accompanied with a higher risk compared to an investment option that offers lower return. Unregulated deposit schemes are aimed at cheating small investors who dont understand this trade-off between risk and return. These fraudulent schemes operate purely by luring investors into schemes with attractive returns without talking about the risk involved.The biggest risk of unregulated investments is that the return is not guaranteed and there is a high probability that the promoters of the scheme may not honour the payments promised under the scheme. Since the scheme is not registered under any of the nine listed regulatory authorities, you cannot approach them for recovering your money in case the scheme turns out to be a fraud.The Unregulated Deposit Schemes Act 2019 makes it illegal to take such deposits, fraudulently default on the payments promised to the depositors, or even promotion of such schemes. Such offenses have been made punishable. Hence next time you hear of an investment schemes that promises you much higher return than what you can get elsewhere and doesnt seem risky, promises to double your money in some time or promises to make you a millionaire without putting anything at stake, try to check on who is running the schemes, if the scheme is registered with any of the regulatory bodies listed in the image here and search for news around that scheme.2",

        "answer": "Sectoral funds are Equity Mutual Funds that focus on businesses operating within a specific industry, like technology, healthcare, energy, or financial services or any other sectors. They invest at least 80% of the funds in stocks from that sector, offering potential returns when the sector performs well. However, this investment approach comes with higher risk due to sector concentration.Characteristics of Sectoral FundsSectoral funds concentrate on specific sectors, which means they mainly invest in companies within those sectors. This concentration can result in higher returns when the chosen sectors perform well. However, it also brings a higher risk if those sectors underperform. As a result, the returns from these funds can be unpredictable and may fluctuate depending on the performance of the selected sectors.Advantages of Sectoral Mutual Funds1. Diversification within one industry allows you to spread investments across different companies or assets in a specific sector.2. Potential for higher returns as these funds focus on well-performing businesses within a particular industry.If you have a strong belief in the prospects of a specific industry and are willing to accept relatively higher risks, Sectoral Funds may be worth considering.DisclaimerMutual Fund investments are subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.2",

        "question": "Cost of Delay in Investments",
        "answer": "Suppose you have a malfunctioning air conditioner (AC) during the winter season. You assume that you won't require it at the moment and put off repairing it. But when summer arrives and the heat becomes unbearable, you must repair the AC. Unfortunately, it is the peak demand time, and finding a repair technician becomes challenging. When a technician finally arrives, they inform you that the repair will take an additional week and will be more expensive due to the increased cost of obtaining the necessary motherboard, which is in high demand.Delaying your AC repair to later months, just when you need it, ended up becoming a costly affair.The cost of delay in investments works in a similar manner. By delaying your investment, you may effectively delay your ability to generate income from your money. It may hamper your ability to meet investment goals, such as starting a business or saving for retirement, which may result in missed opportunities and lose potential profits.The Cost of Delayed Investments in Real TermsWhether or not you have a financial goal, you should start working towards your savings and investments immediately. The cost of delay can be substantial. If you know the power of compounding, you know that time can add a lot of money to your investments. Lets understand this better with an example.You know retirement planning is crucial, and you should start saving for it as soon as possible. You are 27 years old and think you have enough time to work on your retirement. You promise to start at 30 with a monthly SIP of Rs 5,000. However, when you turn 30, new responsibilities may crop up. Let us assume, you get married. So, you put off retirement planning for a few years. At 35, you decide enough is enough and start investing Rs 7,500 a month in a mutual fund. This is how your corpus would look in each circumstance:DetailsStart at 25Start at 30Start at 35Time to retirement (assuming you retire at 60) (a)353025Amount invested per month (b)Rs 5,000Rs 5,000Rs 7,500Assumed Return on Investment*10%10%10%Invested amountRs 21,00,000Rs 18,00,000Rs 22,50,000Total corpus accumulated with returns (subject to risks)Rs 1,89,83,190Rs 1,13,96,627Rs 99,51,251Cost of delayed investment-Rs 41,78,748Rs 90,31,940* The above calculations are for illustration purposes only. Invested amount was calculate using the formula: a*b*12. The total corpus accumulated with returns was calculated using the Cost of delay calculator. The cost of delaying investment was determined by subtracting the total corpus accumulated at a specific age from the total corpus built since the age of 25.As you can see, the cost of delayed investment is huge, even if you increase your monthly SIP. To match the end amount with a SIP at 25 with Rs 5,000, you would have to invest Rs 14,300 every month if you start at 35. Isnt this a huge cost for delaying your investment by a few years?Using a cost of delay calculator, you can estimate how much money you stand to lose if you delay your investments.Why Start Investing Early?1.Time Is On Your SideInvesting early gives you the advantage of time. The longer your investments are held, the more time they have to grow and accumulate returns. This means that even small investments made early on have the potential to result in significant wealth over time.2.Compound InterestInvesting early allows you to take advantage of the power of compounding. Compound interest is when your investment earnings are reinvested and generate returns themselves. Over time, the power of compounding can lead to exponential growth in your investments.3.More Investment OptionsInvesting early gives you more time to explore different investment options and strategies. If one option doesnt work, you can always change your strategy.4.Accomplish Long-Term GoalsInvesting early helps you work towards long-term goals such as retirement, buying a house, orfunding a child's education. The earlier you start investing, the more time you have to build up the resources to achieve these goals.ConclusionThe cost of delayed investments can be substantial and even hinder your long-term financial goals. Whether you invest through a SIP or a lump sum amount in mutual funds, starting as soon as possible can help you meet your goals.

        "answer": "You caninvest in Mutual Fundsthrough regular periodic investments and/or lump sum investments. In the 1st case, you can choose the frequency at which you want to invest. For daily/weekly/monthly frequency, you can automate your investments throughSIP.This automation can be through post-dated cheques, or electronic debit from bank accounts. Electronic debits can be set up through direct debit facility or through NACH (National Automated Clearing House). Application forms are available at respectiveMutual Funds, for the process.This reduces your efforts as you do not have to fill up a fresh form every month or think about which scheme to invest in. Just select the scheme, amount and date and your transactions will happen automatically, for the period you choose. You can set up an SIP for six months or more. Just ensure there is sufficient balance in your bank account.Your question becomes relevant here. If you miss two or three consecutive instalments, the fund house may stop depositing the post-dated cheques and return all the unused cheques, or stop debiting your account. No penalty is levied and neither is there a forfeiture.You can restart your SIP, in the same account, at any point of time.2",

Mutual Funds are heavily regulated bySEBIwhile PMS schemes dont have stringent disclosure norms. Also, PMS products are meant for advanced investors who can understand the risks involved since PMS funds may invest in securities that may not be easily tradable in the market.Mutual Fundsinvest in securities that are liquid. Mutual Funds are less risky than PMS schemes because of their well-diversified portfolio. PMS funds usually have a concentrated portfolio of 20-30 stocks. Thus, the performance of the fund completely depends on the stock picking ability of thefund manager.PMS funds have high entry and exit load apart from a high fund management fee. Mutual Funds have no entry load and can have a small exit load. Mutual Funds are suitable for retail investors while PMS funds are not meant for retail investors.2",

        "answer": "Market risk is the primary risk affecting equity funds. Market risk is the risk of loss in value of securities due to a variety of reasons that affect the entire stock market. Hence market risk is also referred to as systematic risk i.e the risk that cannot be diversified away.Market risk can be attributed to many factors like macroeconomic trends, global economic crisis, geopolitical tension, or even regulatory changes. Equity price risk is the biggest component of market risk affectingequity funds. When the market falls, all stock prices get impacted which in turn affects theperformance of an equity fund. Apart from the above sources of market risk, equity funds can also be prone to currency risk as one of the market risk contributors. Currency risk is relevant to funds that invest in companies having operations in multiple countries.Since equity funds invest in companies across different industries or sectors, they are exposed to industry specific risk i.e the risk of an unfavourable development adversely impacting the companies within an industry. Equity funds can also be impacted by unfavourable development around a company like say a change in management or company policy. This is referred to as company specific risk. Industry and company specific risks, also known as unsystematic risk, can be mitigated through diversification.2",

        "question": "Why is financial independence important for women?",
        "answer": "Enough has been written and spoken about financial independence especially with reference to women in the last two decades. But what does financial independence for women mean? It is subjective and can mean different things to different women. For a working woman, it may mean being able to make her own financial decisions or being able to sustain herself financially. For a homemaker, it may mean being able to spend money whenever she wants or being able to sustain herself during emergencies.At a basic level, financial independence makes women feel more secure and respected irrespective of their socio-economic background. This automatically has a relay effect not just on women but their families, society, and the country at large. More financially independent women mean a more progressive society that is healthier, safer, and less biased. Financially independent women become role models for their children and help in uprooting the age-old gender biases that are deeply rooted in our culture. Financial independence also helps women to retire early to enjoy the blessing of life after all the struggle they have gone through.If financial independence of women is of such importance, how can women help themselves first in achieving it even before families, societies, and the government step in? The simple answer is to be a disciplined investor irrespective of a womans financial earning capabilities and educational background. Whatever may be ones financial strength and educational background, unless a part of ones earnings is saved and invested wisely in the right place in a disciplined manner over time, one will always remain ill-prepared to meet emergencies like job loss, medical expenses, or even the loss of an earning family member.Today, women are working in a variety of roles yet not all working women are financially independent. Most working women still depend on the men-folk of the family when it comes to making investments. Also, they may not be saving enough or even if they are saving, the savings may not be done smartly i.e it is barely able to beat inflation. This is where women can learn to rely on mutual funds that offer a disciplined way of investing for the long-term through aSystematic Investment Plan (SIP). Even if a woman has little or no earning, she can still put aside as little as Rs.500 from her savings to start a monthly SIP that helps her get closer to financial independence. Hence it is important that every woman realizes to make women feel thatmutual fund investingis easy and achievable.2",

        "question": "What is a Money Market Fund?",
        "answer": "Money market funds are one kind of mutual fund that primarily invests in money market instruments that mature within one year. Money market means the financial market that deals with very short-term fixed-income instruments. The typical participants of money market funds are banks, institutional investors, corporations, other financial institutions, and more.A money market fund will specifically carry characteristics such as a short investment duration, high liquidity, lower interest rates, and relatively lower yields.Since money market funds invests in securities for a period of 1 year or less, they keep tweaking the duration so as to generate better returns and keep risk under control.Moreover, these funds work similarly to any other mutual fund, but they are constructed in a manner that lets thefund managergenerate higher returns while keeping their risks under control through adjustments of the lending duration.The primary characteristics of a money market fund are as follows:They have a short maturity tenure:The money market funds could range from a day to a year, based on the fund category.They hold lower rates of interest:The interest rate sensitivity of fixed-income securities is directly linked to their maturity period. The longer the maturity, the higher the interest rate, and vice-versa.They are highly liquid:They offer a high level of liquidity as they invest in liquid and secure debt-based assets.Lower Returns:The longer the maturity, the higher the yield of fixed-income securities. The shorter the maturity, the lower the yield of fixed-income securities. Since money market funds come with short maturities compared to NCDs (non-convertible debentures), G-bonds, and more, their yields are lower than longer-duration securities.Just like other investment choices, money market funds also have their merits and demerits and should be considered before investing in them. Also, money market funds are not ideal for long-term investing, but they make a good investment choice for individuals who want to stay invested only for the short term.DisclaimerMutual Fund investmentsare subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.2",

        "answer": "Prior to April 2020,mutual fund dividendswere tax-free in the hands of investors i.e they didnt have to pay income tax on the dividend income from their mutual fund investments. The fund house would deductDividend Distribution Tax (DDT)from the distributable surplus (profit) of the fund to calculate net distributable surplus. This amount was distributed in proportion to the units held in the fund by all those investors who had opted for dividend option.Now, the themutual fundsdont need to deduct DDT at the source, but the investor is liable to pay income tax on dividend from mutual funds as per his/her highest income tax slab. While in the DDT regime, a uniform tax rate impacted the investors who had opted for dividend option, now the impact of tax on dividend income will vary from investor to investor. An investor in the 30% income tax slab will see a higher dividend tax outgo compared to someone in a 20% tax slab.Earlier, the growth option investor wasnt impacted by DDT as the profits made by the fund were reinvested to grow the asset base of the fund. Thus, a growth scheme investor saw an increase in the NAV of his/her units while continuing to hold the same no. of units while a dividend option investor experienced a fall inNAVpost the declaration of dividend.With dividend distribution tax on mutual funds getting abolished, now bothGrowth and Dividend optionwill experience the same distributable surplus. Earlier, a part of this surplus was deducted at source for paying tax by the mutual fund that reduced the net distributable surplus available to the dividend option investors.A dividend reinvest option allows investors to reinvest the dividend but earlier this reinvested dividend amount was lower than the NAV increase Growth option investors experienced because all dividends were declared only after deducting DDT. Now the choice between Growth and Dividend option will depend on your preference for long-term wealth creation vs. need for additional source of income in the present time.2",

        "question": "What are Index Funds?",
        "answer": "Index Funds are passivemutual fundsthat mimic popular market indices. The Fund Manager doesnt play an active role in selecting industries and stocks to build the funds portfolio but simply invests in all the stocks that make up the index to be followed. The weightage of the stocks in the fund closely matches the weightage of each of the stock in the index. This is passive investment i.e the fund manager simply copies the Index while building the funds portfolio and tries to maintain the portfolio in sync with its index at all times.If the weight of a stock within the index changes, thefund managermust buy or sell units of the stock to have its weight in the portfolio aligned to that of the index. While passive management is easier to follow, the fund doesnt always produce the same returns as that of the index due to tracking error.Tracking error occurs because it is always not easy to hold the securities of the index in the same proportion and transaction costs are incurred by the fund in doing so. Despite tracking error,index fundsare ideal for those who dont want to take the risk ofinvesting in mutual fundsor individual stocks but would like to gain from exposure to the broader market.2",

        "question": "Whats the right age to start financial planning for retirement?",
        "answer": "The best time to start planning and investing for your retirement is to start today whatever may be your current age and financial position in life. The sooner you start investing for a goal, the more time your money gets to compound itself. Suppose, you are 30-year-old today and start a monthly SIP of INR 2000 for next 30 years. Your money gets a long time to compound and grow. Assuming an annual interest rate of 12%, you can have a retirement corpus of 70 lakhs against an outlay 7.2 lakhs over 30 years.If you started the sameSIPa decade later, you will end up accumulating 20 lakhs for an outlay of 4.8 lakhs over 20 years. As you can see a delay of 10 years reduced your retirement corpus by one-third. Unfortunately, most people dont realise thepower of compoundingover the long-term and end up missing the opportunity to create a bigger retirement corpus by starting out late. Delaying investments by a few years is a loss of time and hence the opportunity for the money to multiply.Everyone should start planning for their financial goals and invest towards these goals as soon as they have settled in their first job. At the end, the steady long-term investor wins the race.*Please note that these calculations are for illustrations only and do not represent actual returns. Mutual Funds do not have a fixed rate of return and it is not possible to predict the rate of return.2",

        "answer": "During a long drive, do you worry about your speed or the destination and how to get there? Obviously, you dont count the bumps but focus on reaching your destination safely in time. The same goes with Mutual Funds. You shouldnt worry about the dailyNAVfluctuations but rather focus on whether it is taking you closer to the financial goal in the time you have set for it.During the drive, there are numerous times when your speed drops to near zero, but the vehicle picks up speed once you get over the bump and continue your journey. At the end of the trip, what matters is the average speed you clocked to reach your destination. Similarly, amutual fundcan have numerous bumps in the short-term but the longer you stay invested, the impact of these fluctuations decrease and your chances of earning a positive return goes up just like your cars average speed during a long trip.Every economy and hence market go through periods of growth and recession which impact your funds return but only in the short-term. Over the long-term, your fund would have gone through several such bouts of ups and downs, but their impact would be muted because its the long-term compounded total return that will count at the end of your investment journey.2854",

Does that mean you should considerinvesting in Mutual Fundsonly when you have a specific goal in mind and not otherwise? No! Even in the absence of financial goals, they are a good choice for anyone wishing to grow his/her savings or remain prepared at all times should a goal emerge in the future.The best sportsmen or sportswomen are those who keep practicing their sports through all seasons. Their preparation begins much before they come into limelight. When they start, they may not be even aiming for big goals of winning national or international titles immediately. But when an opportunity arises in terms of selection for a team be it in school, college, or at state and national level, they are able to make the most of it only because of their better preparedness.The same goes for financial goals in life. When you start working, you may not have any goals apart from meeting your monthly expenses. But its better to start investing from the time you start earning because goals are bound to emerge as you progress through life, be it for yourself or your family. When you start investing even without a goal in mind, you are better prepared to face various financial demands in life. Moreover, you become more disciplined when it comes to investing. It takes time and patience to build a corpus and the sooner you start, the better chances you have of managing any financial demand.2",

        "answer": "There have been many changes in the financial services sector, thanks to advancements in technology. Today, you can transact online to pay, to buy, and even to invest.Naturally, this has led to new-age digital trends too like easy-to-trade virtual assets that do not exist in physical format. They are not created or issued by the government or the central bank. Thus, they cannot be used as money or legal tender. However, some risks remain like:- The value of such digital assets is not tethered to a real asset. As a result, their valuesand your investment, as a resultcan be subject to great volatility.- Virtual assets are not regulated. Without government regulations, investors can be exposed to fraud and lose their money.- Currently, these virtual assets attract one of the highest levels of taxation, as per the Union Budget 2022.Mutual Funds, in comparison, have been around since 1924. Over the last century, MFs have been well-regulated and closely monitored for investor protection. There are also enough schemes available to suit different return and risk requirements. Plus, they are inherently diversified, thus, reducing the investors risk. Mutual Funds also come with the added benefit of attracting some of the lowest taxes among all investment options. (You can read about how Mutual Funds are taxedhere.)New trends always have a novelty value. They can, thus, seem quite attractive to investors. However, its important to weigh the risks too before investing your hard-earned money. Research thoroughly and decide if a particular investment option suits your risk profile and return expectations. Investment decisions are made for life and its worth spending some time in arriving at these choices.2",

You can also invest regularly in smaller amounts throughSIPin an Index Fund.

        "answer": "Mutual Funds invest in securities, be it equity or debt, whose values fluctuate along with market movement. This makes them risky because NAV of the fund depends on the individual security values held in the funds portfolio. But since mutual funds invest in securities across different sectors, they diversify this market risk. Since a fund invests in many securities, the risk that all of them will go down in value on any day is reduced. Thus, it is true that mutual funds diversify risk, but they dont eliminate it. The diversification followed by afund managerreduces the market risk of the fund to the extent of diversification. The more diversified a fund is, the less risky it is.Concentrated funds like thematic or sector funds are riskier thanmulti-cap fundswill impact all the companies of the affected sector in some way or the other while in a multi-cap fund, the diversification across sector and capitalization works like an airbag during a car accident, reducing the impact of the unfavourable condition on the fundsNAV.When youinvest in Mutual Funds, look at the degree of diversification in the funds sector allocation.

        "question": "What are FMPs and why should I invest in them?",
        "answer": "Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs) are close-ended debt funds with a fixed maturity somewhat like fixed deposits. But FMPs are different from fixed deposits because they invest in marketable debt securities like certificate of deposits (CDs), commercial papers (CPs), other money market instruments, corporate bonds, non-convertible debentures (NCDs) of reputed companies, or in government securities, maturing in line with the tenure of the scheme. Moreover, unlike fixed deposits, FMPs dont have a guaranteed rate of return.Being close-ended with securities maturing in line with the tenure of the fund, FMPs carry less liquidity and interest rate risk as compared to open-ended debt funds. FMPs are a suitable option if you are looking to lock your money for some time over the fixed period. FMPs offer tax-efficient returns through indexation as compared to fixed deposits because the return from FMPs are adjusted for inflation and then taxed. Since debt funds enjoy a 20% long-term capital gains tax after 3 years along with indexation benefits, three-year FMPs are cost effective compared to FDs of same tenure.If you want to put aside some money for goals like vacation, childs college admission, or down payment for a home loan that you foresee in the next three to five years, you can invest the money in a FMP with a maturity close to the time horizon of your goal. If you dont have a goal and are afraid that you may spend away your savings unnecessarily, you can still invest in FMPs to lock your savings for a while since FMPs have maturities ranging from one month to five years.2",

Even the best market analysts cant predict with absolute precision how the market will move the very next moment because financial markets are driven by sentiments and market sentiments are driven by market news.An investor today has easy access to market news that may be factually correct or could be a rumour or mere speculation. While investment decisions based on factually correct news may yield positive results, investment decisions based on rumours or speculations can cause loss to investors.According to Behavioural Finance Theory, investors are irrational by nature i.e their investment behaviour is not backed by thorough research and analysis but rather influenced by various cognitive and emotional biases including herd mentality.

        "question": "SIP Vs STP - Know the Difference",
        "answer": "Systematic Transfer Plan (STPs) or Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are similar in the sense that they help to make regular investments at a fixed frequency. However, they are different in the way they function. We can understand both individually and the difference between SIP and STP.1. SIP:SIPs are a form of investment in Mutual Funds. It lets the investor invest a fixed amount in any Mutual Fund Scheme at regular intervals, such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and more. It is more of a systematic and disciplined form of investment in Mutual Funds.2. STP:STP is when an investor can transfer money from one Mutual Fund Scheme to another Mutual Fund Scheme of the same Fund House. With an STP, you pre-determine a fixed amount to be transferred from one Mutual Fund Scheme to another in a pre-set time frequency. This strategy is popularly used among investors when they have a lumpsum but want to stagger investing to reduce volatility.Both these attributes are distinctive in nature therefore, we can understand SIP vs STP and how they work with some simple examples.SIP Example:An investor who wants to invest in a mutual fund in the form of a SIP will have to first choose the right mutual fund, select the investment frequency (e.g., every month), choose the amount he/she wishes to invest (say/e.g., Rs. 10,000), set up the Scheme and automatic debits from their bank account to the chosen fund. This enables Rs. 10,000 to be invested in the selected Mutual Fund Scheme through the SIP.STP Example:An investor has a corpus of Rs. 20 lakhs lumpsum- but the investor does not want to invest a lumpsum in equity funds as the markets are volatile. Therefore, he/she invests the entire Twenty lakhs in short term debt funds, which are relatively less volatile. Then, he/she can set up an STP for the fund, where money from her debt funds can be transferred into chosen equity funds at regular intervals.STPs can only be set up with Mutual Fund Schemes from the same Fund House. The investor can choose to set up an STP with two or more schemes within one fund house.  Investor should check for any exit load in the debt fund where the lumpsum has been invested.DisclaimerMutual Fund investments are subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.2",

        "answer": "Debt Funds invest our money in interest-bearing securities like bonds and money market instruments that promise to pay regular interest. These interest payments are received by the fund which in turn contributes to the total return we, as investors of the fund, earn. When the interest rates change in the market, prices of fixed income securities like bonds and money market instruments also change but in the opposite direction. When interest rates rise, prices of these assets fall and vice-versa. Thus, NAVs of Debt Funds change with change in prices of these securities. Changes inNAVimpact the total return generated by these funds.Other than interest rate changes, changes in the credit rating of bonds can impact returns from debt funds. Credit ratings signify the creditworthiness of bond issuers. A downgrade in rating will lower the prices of these bonds. This, in turn, will cause downward pressure on NAVs of funds holding these bonds. Thus, a credit downgrade of bonds held in the portfolio of a Deb Fund can lower your returns.Increase in default risk or the chances of bond issuer failing to pay interest or return principal adversely affects returns fromDebt Fundssince the interest payments add to your total return  from Debt Funds since the interest payments add to your total return from the fund.2",

If you are new toMutual Fundsand want to try them out before going the whole hog, then overnight funds are for you.Overnight Funds are a type of open-ended debt scheme that invests in debt securities maturing the next day. This means, the securities in the portfolio mature every day and thefund manageruses the proceeds to buy new securities for the portfolio maturing the very next day. Since the securities in these funds mature the next day, these funds are not exposed to the kind of interest rate risk or default risk like the rest of thedebt funds. This low risk profile also implies they offer the least return.Overnight funds are suitable for businessmen or entrepreneurs who constantly need to park large sums of money for very short periods of time until it can be deployed elsewhere.

        "question": "What Is the Difference Between SIP and Mutual Fund?",
        "answer": "Breakdown: Mutual Fund and SIPsA Mutual Fund is a financial product, while a SIP is a way to invest in Mutual Funds. When you choose the SIP method, you're still investing in a Mutual Fund scheme.Let's explore how investing in Mutual Funds and SIPs can help you secure your financial futureWhat is a Mutual Fund?In a Mutual Fund, multiple investors pool their money to invest in assets like stocks, bonds, and other securities. Experienced fund managers look after that money . However, this professional management and expertise come with associated costs. These fees are typically a small percentage of the total assets managed by the fund and are deducted from the fund's returns. As an investor, you own units representing a portion of the fund's total assets. The net asset value of these units changes based on the market performance of the underlying securities.When it comes to investing in a Mutual Fund, you have two options:1. Lump Sum Method:Whenever you have surplus cash, you can deploy that in an open-ended mutual fund scheme. There is no restriction on the maximum amount you can invest. The minimum amount mostly starts at Rs 500 for lump sum investments.2. SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans):Through SIP, you have the option to contribute a regular amount, starting from as low as Rs 101.When you invest in mutual funds, you will be allocated units equivalent to the Mutual Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) on those specific dates. The NAV essentially signifies the market value of one unit of the Mutual Fund on a particular date.Why Invest Through SIPs?1.Rupee Cost AveragingYou buy a fixed amount of Mutual Fund units at regular intervals, purchasing more when the market is down and fewer when it's up, averaging out your investment costs. That is rupee cost averaging.2.Start SmallSIPs are accessible to anyone, regardless of the amount you can invest. You can start with as little as Rs 500 a month and still witness impressive returns over time. The minimum amount for an investment in mutual funds varies from one scheme to another.3.Flexibility and ControlSIPs offer the flexibility to choose the investment amount and frequency that suits your financial situation. You can increase, decrease, pause or stop contributions.4.Power of CompoundingIf you stay invested for the long-term, your money multiplies giving you the benefit of power of compounding, subject to market risk.5.Disciplined Investment HabitSIPs help you build a disciplined investment approach. You can designate multiple SIPs for different financial goals and achieve them.Ways to Invest in Mutual FundsDirect investment:You invest directly via the mutual fund company. This means you take charge of the entire investment process, from selecting funds to making the investment. It often comes with lower fees since there's no middleman involved.Distributor investment:If you choose to invest through a distributor, you're working with an intermediary like a financial advisor or broker. They guide you in choosing suitable funds and manage the technical stuff. However, this option might have added costs due to the distributor's services.DisclaimerMutual Fund investments are subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.2",

        "question": "What is the Total Return Index (TRI) in a Mutual Fund?",
        "answer": "The Total Return Index, (TRI), plays a crucial role in evaluating equity indexes.Total Return variant of an Index (TRI) takes into account all dividends/ interest payments that are generated from the basket of constituents that make up the index in addition to the capital gains. Hence, TRI is more appropriate as a benchmark to compare the performance of mutual fund schemes.The major characteristics of TRI are:SEBI Mandate:In 2018, SEBI mandated the use of TRI for evaluating the performance of the mutual fund. Now, mutual funds must disclose their performance based on the Total Return Index rather than the Price Return Index (The previous method), which only considers capital appreciation. This compliance not only enhances investors' trust but also upholds industry standards.Incorporates Dividends:This income includes stock dividends, interest from bonds, and other income sources within the Benchmark Index.Reinvestment:TRI assumes that any income generated, such as dividends, is reinvested into the Index.Investor Transparency:It provides a realistic and transparent view of the fund's performance. It functions as a guiding reference to assess the scheme's growth and performance across time.Long-Term Goals:TRI is ideal for evaluating funds over long periods.DisclaimerMutual Fund investments are subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.2",

They aim to earn returns through interest and capital growth. This flexibility suits different investment objectives and risk tolerances. Fixed-income Mutual Funds are also called Debt or Bond Funds.Fixed-Income Mutual Funds provide numerous features for investors, such as:Diversification:These funds offer diversification by spreading investments across various fixed-income securities, such as government and corporate bonds, reducing overall portfolio risk.Liquidity: Open-ended fixed income fundsallow for liquidation, particularly during urgent financial situations as they dont have any lock-in periodRelatively Lower Risks:These funds are widely regarded as low to medium risk, although not entirely risk-free.Additional Income:Fixed income fundsmay provide an extra source of cash flow, especially through systematic withdrawal plans, subject to management fees supplementing your primary earnings and enhancing overall financial stability.Retirement Planning:These funds can serve as a key component inretirement planning, to plan for a low risk, low return income stream during post-employment years throughSystematic Withdrawal Plans, subject to market risks andperformance of the fund.Fixed-Income mutual funds are attractive to risk-averse investors. They are suitable for individuals seeking consistent, modest, returns rather than high-risk investments.Fixed-Income funds do not guarantee returns.

        "question": "How long does one need to stay invested in a Mutual Fund?",
        "answer": "One of the most important considerations before choosing an investment avenue is the expected time horizon, i.e., time in days, months, or years that an investor intends to stay invested.And why is this so important?All investments should ideally result from a financial or investment plan. Such plans usually indicate how long it would take for a financial objective to be met.Lets consider an investor who just made \u20b9 50 lacs in a real estate transaction. He is looking for a safe avenue to invest, before he takes a final decision on what to do with that money. An ideal scheme in this case would be a Liquid Fund, which is designed to provide liquidity with a high probability of capital protection. He can redeem whenever he has made up his mind.Therefore, the decision on how long one needs to stay invested depends onthe investment objective. Investors need to periodically review investment status and progress with financial experts, i.e., investment advisors or MF distributors. During such reviews, decisions to redeem, switch, invest or leave alone are usually made.2",

        "answer": "Youve lent 5 lakhs to your friend who owns a start-up @8% interest (higher than current bank rate of 7%). Even though youve known him for years, you still run the risk that he may not return your money on time or may fail to pay back. Also, the bank rate may rise to 8.5% while you are stuck with 8%.Likewise,Debt Fundsinvests your money in an interest-bearing securities like bonds and money market instruments. These securities promise to make regular interest payments to these funds. Hence Debt Funds are prone to three major risks like you when you lend money to friends.Firstly, since these funds invest in interest-bearing securities, theirNAVfluctuate with changing interest rates (interest rate risk). Prices of these funds fall when interest rates rise and vice-versa.Secondly, these funds are subject to credit risk i.e. the risk of not receiving the regular payments from the underlying securities (e.g. bonds) they have invested in.In the worst-case scenario, these funds can face default risk where the bond issuer fails to make the promised payment. When a bond in the underlying portfolio of a Debt Funds defaults in its payments, this impacts the interest income component of the fund thereby adversely affecting your total return from the fund.2",

        "answer": "Minors can invest inMutual Fundsthrough their parents/guardians. The minor is the first and sole account holder in this case and is represented either by a natural guardian (father/mother) or legal guardian (court appointed). A minor represented by natural guardian attains majority at 18 years of age while those represented by legal guardians attain majority at 21 years of age.Once the Minor attains Majority, you need to apply for change of status of the sole account holder from Minor to Major or all future transactions (SIP/SWP/STP) would be suspended in the account otherwise. Usually Mutual Funds send a notice to the guardian and the minor for submitting necessary documents in advance. Guardian needs to apply for changing the status to Major along with Minors signature duly attested by a bank official. Bank account registration form and KYC of the Minor also needs to be submitted along with the application.The tax implications will now have to borne by the sole account holder (Major). Until the child is a minor, all incomes and gains from the child's account is clubbed under the parent/guardian's income and the parent/guardian pays the applicable taxes. In the year the Minor attains Majority, he/she will be treated as a separate individual and will pay taxes for the number of months for which he/she is a Major in that year.2",

        "answer": "If you are looking for a Mutual Fund that has no risk of loss, there arent any! Allmutual fundsare subject to some risk factor or the other. While Equity MutualFunds are subject to market risk, debt funds are subject to interest rate risk and default risk. Amongst the debt funds, the degree of risk is different depending on the average maturity of the portfolio. Longer the maturity of a debt funds portfolio, higher is the interest rate risk and default risk.Overnight Fundsare a kind of debt fund that invest in debt securities maturing the next day. Hence these funds have the shortest maturity amongst alldebt funds. Thus,they carry the least interest rate risk and default risk.While we cant assume that Overnight Funds have no risk attached to them, it is safe to assume that they have the least risk amongst all funds put together. Hence,they are considered ideal for parking large sums of cash for a very short period by taking the least riskwhen the sole purpose is to ensure the capital is safe without much expectation for returns.Overnight funds are suitable not only for larger institutions that havelarge sums of cash but also for small investors who want to invest their liquid money for a short period.2",

        "answer": "Index Funds are passively managedMutual Fundsthat simply copy a popular market index like the Sensex or Nifty. While Index Funds carry relatively lower market risk as compared to actively managed funds, thefund managerhas limited ability to manage sharp corrections because the fund must hold all the securities in the index in the same proportion. He/she cant buy more of an undervalued stock or sell an overvalued stock to take advantage of these market corrections.Since Index funds track specific market indices, they end up with a portfolio of established securities within a specific market segment be it large caps, small caps, multi caps, banking stocks, corporate bonds, etc. Thus, they limit the investors selection universe.In spite of mimicking a market index, these funds dont provide the same return as the market index due to the presence of tracking error. A market index doesnt incur any cost when it undergoes a change in composition i.e when some security is added or removed from it. An index fund has to bear transaction cost to ensure its portfolio mirrors that of the index. Also, there could be a time lag when the stocks or weightage of individual stocks in an index undergo some change. This lowers the Index Funds return as compared to its Index return.2",

The money collected from investors is then pooled together.

        "answer": "Whether one invests \u20b9 500 or \u20b9 5 crores, the returns are the same. Confused?Not if you consider the returns on a percentage basis. For example, if a scheme has returns of 12% per annum, then an investment of \u20b9 500 would grow to \u20b9 627.20 in two years. An investment of \u20b9 100,000 in the same scheme would be \u20b9 1,25,440 during the same period. While the rate of appreciation is the same in both cases, only the final amounts differ because of difference in initial investments.We need to bear two things in mind here. Returns in percentage terms is the same for any amount invested. However, a larger amount invested at the start would result in larger absolute gains.All of this should not distract an investor from making a start. That is the most important act in investing.2",

        "question": "What is the role of an investment advisor or a Mutual Fund distributor in selecting a scheme?",
        "answer": "Usually, when people select a scheme themselves, they do so based on its performance. They dont consider that past performances may not be sustained. Evaluation of schemes is a function of various attributes of the schemes, e.g. scheme objective, investment universe, the risks that the fund is taking, etc. This requires the investor to put in time and effort. The investor also needs to have the requisite expertise to be able to understand the features and nuances as well as the ability to analyse and compare from among many options. Adistributor of mutual fundsor an investment advisor would be qualified and trained for such a job.Secondly, more important than investing in the best scheme, its important to invest in a scheme most appropriate or suitable to the investors current situation. Though the investors situation is best known to the investor, a good advisor or distributor would be able to ask the right questions and put things in perspective.Once the portfolio is constructed, regular monitoring of the scheme characteristics and portfolio is required, which is an ongoing job. An advisor/distributor helps you review these schemes too.2",

        "answer": "When the markets turn volatile many investors start doubting their investment decisions and think of stopping their SIPs or withdrawing their investments. Its natural to get worried when you see your investments in red during a volatile market. But it would be wise to stay put with your SIPs especially during a falling market because with the same amount of monthly investments you will end up buying more units. We all love to bargain shopping be it during an online sale or simply at the sabzi shop. Isnt it? Then why not for ourMutual Fund investmentswhen prices are falling?The market is more unpredictable than even our weather forecast apps. You can never time yourself perfectly to invest a lumpsum amount when the market falls. What if the market falls further after youve invested? Similarly, you cannot time yourself perfectly to sell at a market high because the market may go up further after youve sold. If you try to catch the market, you will be grossly disappointed, and your returns can be affected due to wrong timing. Hence it is better to invest regularly through highs and lows of the market by investing through aSIPwith a clear focus on your goals. You need not worry about market volatility since the cost of your investments will average out over a period.2854",

        "answer": "When you lend money, the critical thing to check is how credible the borrower is. And in terms of credibility, nothing surpasses the government. When you invest in gilt funds, you're essentially investing in central or state government bonds.The term \"Gilt\" refers to government securities. These are sovereign instruments. They invest in securities with medium to long maturities ranging from three years to twenty years.  A lock-in period of 10 years is only applicable to Gilt Funds with a constant duration of 10 years.As per SEBI guidelines, Gilt Funds must invest at least 80%  of their money in Government Securities and State Development Loans (SDLs), the balance in cash and cash equivalents.Working Mechanism of Gilt FundsWhen the government needs funds, it borrows money through an issue of sovereign bonds. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is a banker to such offerings of government securities. Gilt Funds invest in these securities.There are many benefits to investing in Gilt Funds. The government bond market is primarily made of institutional players. Retail investors can buy but minimum investment is prohibitive for small investors. Gilt Funds offer you a chance to invest in government securities even with a small amount of money, ensuring easy access to different government securities. Returns depend on Yield to Maturity (YTM) , where higher YTM can mean lower returns and vice versa. If held to maturity, there can be no failure due to sovereign guarantee on bonds.Fund managers play a key role in grasping the interest rate cycle, which helps in deciding the best times to invest in government securities. This is important because when inflation goes up, interest rates usually follow suit.DisclaimerMutual Fund investments are subject to market risks, read all scheme-related documents carefully.2",

        "answer": "Mutual Fund performance is assessed based on its returns or performance, and the two most important performance metrics used in evaluating Mutual Funds are:(a) Trailing Returns(b) Rolling ReturnsSo, let us now understand the concepts behind the two widely used methods for calculating returns in mutual funds and uncover the differences between them. The scheme returns so calculated when compared to its respective benchmark would reflect either out-performance or under performance by the scheme.Trailing Returns:Trailing Returns in mutual funds are a way to measure how a fund has performed between two specific dates. Trailing Returns are also commonly referred to as \"point-to-point\" returns. They offer a brief overview of the fund's performance at a given point in time and can be computed over different time frames, including year-to-date (YTD), one year, three years, and beyond, or even from the fund's beginning to the present day.Rolling Returns:Rolling returns, sometimes called \"rolling period returns\" or \"rolling time periods,\" indicate the average annualised returns calculated for a given time frame. They offer a valuable means of evaluating how Mutual Funds perform over time, mirroring the actual experiences of investors holding period. Evaluating a portfolio or fund's Rolling Returns provides a smoothed-out performance perspective across different time intervals in its history.To calculate Rolling Returns of mutual funds, you analyse the fund's performance over various time periods, usually using a specified interval, such as daily, weekly, or monthly, and compute the average annualised returns for each of these periods.In conclusion, Trailing Returns measure a fund's historical performance over a specific period, while Rolling Returns provide a more dynamic view by analyzing performance over various overlapping time frames. These metrics help investors assess a fund's consistency and potential for future returns of a mutual fund.DisclaimerMutual Fund investments are subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.2",

When you buy a fund, you pay its price i.e.NAVto own a unit of the fund. A big fund with more investors putting their money in it will have a large asset base and thus a higher NAV. But the same fund may have had a much lower NAV when it was launched because NAV of a fund increases over time as the fund grows larger with more investors joining it. But does that mean the recipe of the fund has changed or the process of making it?The allocation to different asset classes and kinds of securities and the fund management process remains the same if the investment objective of the fund hasnt changed.

        "answer": "When you drive around the city, sometimes you find an empty stretch and speed up to 80kmph while at other times you have to slow down to 20kmph due to traffic or a speed breaker. Finally, you end up clocking an average speed of say 45kmph or 55kmph depending on how often you had to slow down or speed up.Just like the average speed of your drive through the city, that is neither too fast not too slow, investing in Mutual Funds through SIPs help to navigate the highs and lows of the market with ease. We all know, it is impossible to time the market. Hence an investor can never perfectly time the market highs/lows to buy/sell his or her investments. In such a scenario, a disciplined approach to investing can help investors achieve better control over the impact of market volatility.When you invest a fixed amount in aMutual Fundsregularly on pre-defined dates every month over a long period of time, market volatility has less bearing on your investments. This is because you end up buying more units with the same amount when markets fall and buy fewer units with the same amount when markets rise. Thus, the average unit cost of the total units held by you tends to fall over time even if the market moves either way during this period. This is the essence ofrupee cost averaging in SIPs.If you continue with yourSIP investmentover a long period of time like five years or even longer, if the market has gained, the average cost of units tends to be lower than the prevailing NAV.SIPs makerupee cost averaging benefitspossible apart from offering the power of compounding.power of compoundingbecomes more effective over a longer holding period since your investments get more time to multiply further and help in building wealth without pinching your wallet too much.2",

        "answer": "A retirement mutual fund helps you plan for your lifestyle after you stop earning a regular income.Retirement mutual funds allocate investments to both stocks and bonds, gradually shifting towards lower-risk options as retirement approaches. They offer regular income for retirees and have no exit fees with low expense ratios. However, they come with a lock-in period that can last up to five years or until retirement.Characteristics of Retirement Mutual FundsRetirement Mutual Funds are made for the long haul, matching your retirement plans. These funds usually need you to keep your money invested for around 5 years or more. This helps stop you from taking out your money too soon and keeps it ready for your retirement.Retirement funds spread your money across different assets like stocks, bonds, and sometimes real estate . This mix helps balance out the risks and the potential gains over a long time.These funds try to find the right mix between things that grow your money and things that keep it stable. They do this by investing some money in stocks and some in bonds, all based on what you need for retirement.Even though they have some money in stocks, they're careful and don't put too much. This is different from normal funds that put more in stocks. It's to be safer with your money.Some retirement funds also help you with taxes. When you put money in these funds, you might pay less tax. This can save you money in the long run.Are Mutual Funds a Good Option for Retirement Planning?Retirement mutual funds can be a good option for retirement planning, depending on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.For starters, retirement mutual funds are naturally diversified into different equity and debt instruments, which can help mitigate risks and provide potential returns.Once you reach retirement age, retirement mutual funds may offer the option of receiving regular payouts at regular intervals, such as monthly or quarterly, based on the accumulated corpus. The regular payout can provide you with a steady income stream during retirement.Besides, the fact that professionals manage retirement mutual funds is also beneficial.

But who should invest in index funds?Index funds are an ideal investment choice for relatively risk-averse investors as these funds map a particular market index, making them less prone to equity-linked risks. However, there is still risk and volatility when the market is downturned.They can also be a suitable choice for investors who are new to mutual fund. This is because the investment in index funds only relies on the index fund's portfolio manager to match or track the underlying index's performance over time.Index funds are also historically known to give good to moderate returns over a long investment horizon, making them suitable choices for long-term investors.While index funds are generally considered moderate/high risk, it's important to note some potential limitations, including:\u2022 Limited flexibility compared to non-index funds.\u2022 There is a risk of the fund manager not accurately tracking the chosen index.\u2022 There is a chance of the fund underperforming in comparison to the index it aims to replicate.To conclude, investing in index funds will primarily depend on the investor's investment factors, such as risk tolerance, financial objectives, etc. The above features can help determine the factors that influence investing in the fund.DisclaimerMutual Fund investments are subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.2",

        "question": "Which type of Equity Fund has the lowest risk and which has the highest?",
        "answer": "Mutual Fundsare prone to a variety of risk factors depending on categorization and thereby their underlying portfolios. Equity Mutual Funds are prone to many risks but the most significant one is market risk.Equity Mutual Fundsas a category are considered High Risk investment products. While all equity funds are exposed to market risks, the degree of risk varies from fund to fund and depends on the type of equity fund.Large cap funds that invest in large cap company stocks i.e stocks of well-established companies with sound financials are considered to be the least risky because these stocks are considered to be safer than stocks of mid cap and smaller companies. Low risk equity mutual funds usually have a well-diversified portfolio that is spread across sectors in the large cap category.Index fundsandETFsbased on broad-based market indices that follow a passive strategy are also considered to be low risk as they mimic well-diversified market indices.Focused funds, sectoral funds, and thematic funds are at the other end of the risk spectrum because they hold concentrated portfolios. High risk equity funds usually suffer from concentration risk due to their holdings that are limited to one or two sectors. Even though focused funds invest in well-known large-cap stocks, they usually hold just 25-30 stocks which increases concentration risk. If thefund managergets his calls right, he can deliver a higher return than a diversified large-cap fund, but the reverse is also possible.Sectoral funds invest in stocks of a single sector like auto, FMCG, or IT and hence carry significant risk because any undesirable event affecting the industry will impact all the stocks in the portfolio adversely. Thematic funds invest in stocks of few related industries that are in demand at present but may lose appeal over the longer term.Investors usually make a generalization that equity funds give a higher return than other funds, but they should be cognizant of the fact that all equity funds are not the same. Return potentials go in tandem with their equity fund risk profile. Hence look for a funds degree of diversification across sectors and top holdings for any concentration risk before you decide to invest in it. Instead of looking at funds with the lowest risk or highest return, you should look for a fund with risk levels acceptable to you.2",

        "answer": "We all have different goals in life. Sometimes they present themselves immediately, sometimes over a period of time. For example, when one starts working, they may not have too much on their mind except regular monthly expenses and some impulsive buys. But eventually, goals arisea bike or car, weekend get-aways, international trips, marriage, so on and so forth.Well, theres a solution that can help us plan for all our financial goals and also be prepared for the newer goals that may arise as we progress through life:Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)You can invest a small amount every month through SIP. Not just that, you can also start goal-based investments; this means starting an SIP for each goal. This way, you can use the power of compounding inMutual Fundsfor different goals like retirement, marriage, and even buying a car or a house. This is when returns earn more returns in the futurecompounding the total return an investor receives. You can read more about thepower of compounding here.For example, one could start their goal-based investments as below:Target amountInvestment durationMF SchemeExpected returns*Investment amountRs 1 lakh2-3 yearsDebt Fund6-8%Rs 2,500 per monthRs 4 lakh5 yearsBalanced Fund10%Rs 5,000 per monthRs 25 lakh10 yearsEquity Fund12%Rs 10,000 per monthRs 10 lakh15 yearsEquity Fund12%Rs 2,000 per monthRs 30 lakh20 yearsEquity Fund12%Rs 3,000 per monthRs 1.5 crore20 yearsDebt Fund8%Rs 30 lakh (lumpsum)*Assumed returns for the MF categoryNote: For illustration purposes only; actual figures may vary depending on market risk.Over the years, you can change the long-termSIP investmentamounts for each of your goals. For example, once you have achieved your dream of buying a vehicle, you can increase the SIP amount for the other goals by Rs 2,000 each. By doing so, you can accumulate more wealth for your goals than initially anticipated.Post retirement, you may want to move your investments to a low-risk Fund, like those that invest in low-risk debt instruments to reduce your risk exposure. This can continue to earn returns even after retirement. In fact, these investments can also help you earn a secondary source of income by way of a Systematic Withdrawal Plan.This way, investing in different Mutual Funds for a suitable duration depending on your goals through SIPs can help you achieve all your dreams and goals in life over different time durations.*Mutual fund investments are subject to market risks read all the scheme related documents carefull",

        "question": "Wont I need a large amount to invest in Mutual Funds?",
        "answer": "People think that Mutual Funds are elite investments made only for the wealthy. The fact is: one does not need large sum toinvest in Mutual Funds, you can start with a sum as low as \u20b9 500, or 5000 depending on the kind of fund you choose.Why keep the minimum amounts as low as these?The economies of scale can be understood easily if we look at travelling by an airplane. The plane would cost a lot of money and, of course, not everybody owns a plane! However, we can afford air travel simply because all the costs are divided among all the passengers using the services at various different points of time.Similarly, a person may not have enough money to create a diversified portfolio through investment in a very large number of investment avenues, one may not have enough money required to conduct or purchase research on investments. However, the economies of scale allow small investors to get multiple benefits throughMutual Funds.Mutual Funds are thus ideal vehicles for small investors for saving and investing.2",

        "question": "How to choose an ETF?",
        "answer": "Just like other investments, choosing anETFdepends on your required asset allocation, financial goal, risk preference and time horizon. Choosing an ETF depends on what kind of asset allocation you want to achieve in your portfolio by adding the ETF to it since ETFs are available for different kinds of asset classes like equities, bods, real estate, commodities. First decide on the asset class for the ETF.Decide on the kind of diversification you want to achieve and the index you want to track. An ETF tracking a broad market index is suitable for achieving maximum diversification with lowest risk. If youre willing to take risk and want exposure to niche market segments, sectors or countries, choose a specific ETF.Look at the ETFs portfolio to understand the exposure it will give you. Picks ETFs with lower tracking error within the asset class and market segment you want to follow. Avoid thinly traded ETFs as theyve wider bid/ask spreads and will increase your trading costs, lowering the returns from your ETF. ETFs tracking narrow market having lower levels of assets (AUM) tend be less liquid and trade at a price that is not in line with their underlying NAV. Look for ETFs that tend to trade close to theirNAV.2",

        "question": "Should I invest in ELSS through SIP or in Lumpsum?",
        "answer": "The choice to invest in ELSS through SIP or in lumpsum depends on when and why are you investing. If you are looking to save tax at the end of the financial year, investing in lumpsum is your only choice. But if you are investing at the beginning of the financial year, you can either invest in lumpsum or throughSIP. ELSS offers tax benefit and also has the growth potential of equities.Investing in ELSSthrough SIP has two benefits. Firstly, you lower the risk by spreading your investments over the year. Secondly, you can get a better average price for your units by investing at differentNAVsthrough the year as compared to investing in lumpsum at one point in time because ofrupee cost averaging.Thirdly, regular investments done in small amounts doesnt pinch your wallet as compared to a lumpsum investment But you need to ensure that the total amount invested through the year is the same as what you would like to allocate for ELSS.Since ELSS funds have a lock-in period of 3 years, if you invest today, you can take your money out only after 3 years in case of lumpsum investment. The lock-in period is also applicable to each SIP payment. If you want to withdraw the full amount invested over 12 months, you will have to wait till the last SIP installment has completed 3 years.2",

        "question": "How should one choose the right type of equity fund for investment?",
        "answer": "Choosing an equity fund for your investment portfolio is like choosing an attire, though the decision-making process is more complex in this case. Just the way you look at a shirt or dress in detail, how well it fits you, the comfort, will it serve the purpose or occasion for which you are buying the outfit, choosing an equity mutual fund for your portfolio requires a similar approach, to put it in simple words.Before you go shopping for an equity fund investment, you need to look at your existing investment portfolio. What kind of investments do you already have just like what kind of clothes you already have in your wardrobe and whats missing from it? You may already be having some equity fund investments or dont have any exposure to equity as an asset class. Hence the next equity fund you pick should fill the current gap in your overall investment portfolio. For instance, if you have already invested in a diversified equity fund, you may consider a different type of equity fund that suits your risk preference and investment goal like sayMulticapormid-cap fund. It could also be a tax saving fund if your goal is to save tax and you dont hold such a fund in your portfolio. You need to spread your equity asset class risk through diversification across different types of funds.The next thing to look for is what the fund looks like in terms of its investment objective, portfolio in terms of sector and stock holding, fund managers, vintage, risk parameters, expense ratio, etc. This is like looking for the style, colour, fabric, and finish of the outfit you want to buy. Then you assess if the details suit you just like the fit of an outfit. The fund must suit your requirement or goal you have in mind. At this point, you may look at itsperformance track recordw.r.t its benchmark.Next time you want to invest in a fund, follow the above selection approach systematically or reach out to a financial expert for help.2",

        "question": "What are Arbitrage Funds?",
        "answer": "Arbitrage Funds are Hybrid Mutual Funds that seek to exploit arbitrage opportunities for the same underlying asset in different capital markets. Arbitrage refers to taking advantage of price differentials of the same asset, such as in the spot and futures markets.A spot market is a place where buyers and sellers agree to a price for an asset and exchange the asset for cash at that moment. In contrast, in a futures market, buyers and sellers agree to a price for an asset at a future date. This means that they are entering into a contract to buy or sell the asset at a specified price on a specific date in the future.Spot prices are determined by supply and demand in the present moment. In a futures market, the price of an asset is based on the expected supply and demand in the future.Arbitrage Funds can trade in equities, debt, and money market instruments. However, they must buy and sell the same asset quantity in two different markets simultaneously to take advantage of the price differential.According to Securities and Exchange Board of India guidelines, Arbitrage Funds must invest at least 65% of their funds in equities. They are also taxed as equity instruments.How Do Arbitrage Funds Work?Arbitrage Funds buy and sell the same quantity of an asset in two different markets and pocket the returns from the price differential. They work on the principle that markets are not entirely efficient, resulting in price differences in different markets.Lets understand with an example. Say a share of X company is trading at Rs 1,000 in the cash market. Futures markets usually carry a premium. So, the price of the same security could be at Rs. 1,030 in the futures market.You could buy shares of X company in the cash market at Rs 1,000 and sell it at the futures market for Rs 1,030. Now there are three different scenarios that can play out. The price of the share goes up to Rs 1,100 on the date of expiry of the futures contract. You would then make a profit of Rs. 100 in the cash market and a loss of Rs. 70 in the futures market. Net-net, you still make a profit of Rs. 30.If the price of the share goes down to Rs. 900, then you lose Rs. 100 in the cash market but make Rs. 130 in the futures market. Your profit is Rs. 30 per share again. If the prices do not change at all, you still make Rs. 30 in the futures market. This is exactly what arbitrage funds do. They take advantage of price differentials in different markets to come up with a scenario to earn profit.Benefits of Arbitrage Funds1. Arbitrage Funds have virtually no price risk. The equity exposure of these funds is wholly hedged.2. Counterparty risk is also eliminated when you invest in Arbitrage Funds because the exchange guarantees settlement.3.Arbitrage Fund can make substantial gains by taking varying positions in the cash and futures markets when the markets are volatile.4. Despite beingHybrid Funds, they are taxed as equities.Things to Consider Before Investing1. RiskWhile Arbitrage Funds may not have price or counterparty risk, funds that invest in debt instruments may be subject to credit risk. Moreover, Arbitrage Funds may not perform well in bearish markets because futures may trade at a discount to cash prices.2. ReturnArbitrage Funds provide reasonable returns.They are suitable investments if you want to make money in the short- to medium term. However, much like other market-linked instruments, there is no guarantee of profit.3. Investment HorizonArbitrage Funds are best suited to investors with an investment horizon of 3-6 months.4. Investment AmountIt is better to invest in Arbitrage Funds through a lumpsum amount rather than Systematic Investment Plans.5. Scheme Offer Document:Before investing in an arbitrage fund, it's important to read the scheme offer document carefully. The document contains important information about the investment objective, investment strategy, risks, asset allocation, and fees associated with the fund.6. Asset Allocation:As mentioned earlier, arbitrage funds invest in a combination of equity and debt instruments. It's important to understand the asset allocation of the fund and how it aligns with your investment goals and risk appetite.7. Management Fees:Like allmutual funds, arbitrage funds charge a management fee for managing the fund. This fee is charged as a percentage of the assets under management and is deducted from the returns generated by the fund. It's important to understand the management fee charged by the fund and how it affects your returns.ConclusionIn summary, investing in an arbitrage fund can be a suitable option for investors looking for a low-risk, moderate-return investment. However, it's important to carefully consider the investment objective, asset allocation, management fees, risks, and track record before investing in an arbitrage fund. If you have any doubt regarding arbitrage funds, be sure to talk to your financial advisor for more clarity.DisclaimerMutual Fund investments are subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.2",

        "answer": "Several questions rest in a potential investors mind regarding the ideal amount to invest. People consider Mutual Funds as just another investment avenue. Is it really the case? Is a Mutual Fund just another investment avenue like a fixed deposit, debenture or shares of companies?AMutual Fundis not an investment avenue, but a vehicle to access various investment avenues.Think of it this way. When you go to a restaurant, you have a choice to order a la carte or buffet/thali or a full meal.Compare the full thali or the meal with a Mutual Fund, whereas individual items you order are the stocks, bonds, etc. A thali makes the choice easy, saves time and also some money.The important thing is tostart investment early, even if small, and gradually add on to your investments as your earnings increase.

        "answer": "Equity Funds invest in stocks of companies whileDebt fundsinvest in bonds of companies and money market instruments. Since these funds invest our money in different assets, they are impacted by risk factors that affect the underlying asset classes.Stocks are affected by market movements. Hence market risk is the single biggest risk factor affectingEquity Funds. International Equity Funds also face currency risk due to fluctuations in exchange rate. Equity funds are more prone to economic and industry risks since stocks are directly impacted by factors affecting the business and economic environment of a company.Bonds are affected by interest rate changes since bonds are nothing but a kind of lending instruments. Thus, interest risk is the biggest risk factor affecting Debt Funds. Bonds are also subject to default and credit downgrades i.e the probability of a bond issuer failing to honour the payments under the bond or getting into a financial crisis that may cripple its ability to honour the bond payments. Hence debt funds face significant default and credit risk.Both types of funds are prone to liquidity risk i.e thefund managermay find it difficult to sell some holdings from the portfolio if they are thinly traded or due to lack of demand for that security.2",

        "question": "Who should invest in (ELSS) Tax Saving Mutual Funds?",
        "answer": "Tax Saving Mutual Fundsor Equity Linked Savings Schemes are diversified equity funds that provide tax deduction benefits under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Hence, ELSS funds are suitable for any taxpayer who is willing to take the risk of an equity-oriented tax savings instrument.ELSS fundsare better suited for the salaried class as they have a regular source of income and need to make tax saving investments every year. In fact, they can conveniently invest in ELSS throughSIPon a monthly basis to benefit fromrupee cost averaging.If you are a young taxpayer, you can take advantage of the dualbenefit of investing in ELSSi.e. avail tax deduction under section 80C and the growth potential of equities over a long-term by investing every year in ELSS. While older taxpayers can also invest in ELSS to avail tax benefit, the equity risk inherent in ELSS demands a longer investment horizon which they may lack.Remember, ELSS funds have a lock-in period of 3 years. If you invest today, you can take your money out only after 3 years in case of lumpsum investment. The lock-in period is also applicable to each SIP payment. If you want to withdraw the full amount invested over 12 months, you will have to wait till the last SIP instalment has completed 3 years. But Its not just about staying put in the fund for the lock-in period but continuing with your investments beyond that to see the real growth potential an ELSS can offer.A young taxpayer with many decades of working life ahead of him/her can leverage the dual advantage of an ELSS better compared to someone who may be close to retirement. But even with 5-7 years left for retirement, one can consider ELSS as an option if he/she has the desired risk appetite. Thus, ELSS can be your preferred tax saving option depending on your age, risk preferences and other liabilities like home and education loans that make the old tax regime more appropriate for you.2",

        "question": "What information and risk parameters should one consider before investing in an equity fund?",
        "answer": "Choosing an equity fund for your portfolio requires a methodical selection process that has two phases. The first one is about you and begins with identifying the need for anequity mutual fundin your portfolio or your financial goal along with its time horizon the type of equity fund investment, and an assessment of your risk tolerance. Once these three things are in place, selecting the suitable fund amongst those available is the next step in the process i.e. second phase.The second phase thus involves searching through all the suitable funds using a more qualitative approach by looking for certain information on the funds and analyzing various risk parameters. You should look for information on fund portfolio, vintage, fund managers, expense ratio, its benchmark, and how the fund has performed w.r.t its benchmark over time.When you look at the portfolio, see how diversified it looks in terms of sector allocation and stock selection. This can be gauged from the funds top 10 sectors and stock holding. When you look at vintage, it gives you an idea of how many economic cycles has the fund weathered. During a bull run, most funds do well but how do funds perform through a complete cycle of bull and bear market phases is an indicator of the portfolios resilience. Fund managers track record is closely linked to the funds vintage. You can look at the other funds managed by thefund managerto get a better view of his/her track record.Expense ratio is an important indicator of how well the fund is being managed operationally which is different from fund performance. Lower the expense ratio, the better it is for an investor.Next, look at key equity fund risk indicators like standard deviation and beta. The former gives you an idea about the funds volatility in returns or fluctuations expected in its returns. Higher standard deviation implies you can expect more volatility in the fund's returns i.e. the return is likely to fluctuate more both ways (positive and negative) from the funds average expected return. Beta is an indicator of the funds sensitivity to market movements. Beta >1 implies the funds NAV is more sensitive to market movements. Hence the fund will rise more than the market during up market phases and also fall more than the market in down market phases. Beta =1 implies the fundsNAVwill move closely with market movement. Low risk equity mutual funds usually have Beta <1.Spend some time yourself or seek guidance from a financial advisor on gathering information on funds and analyzing them before you make the final selection for your portfolio.2",

        "question": "What are Thematic Funds? How do they work?",
        "answer": "Say you care deeply about the environment, and investing in a company that disregards eco-conscious practices simply doesn't align with your values. So, now you're seeking a solution that not only aligns with your moral values but also offers an opportunity to earn potential returns.Enter the world of sustainable investing, where a special kind of fund ensures that only companies adhering to specific environmental norms are included in your investment portfolio. These funds invest in carefully selected businesses that prioritise sustainability, conservation, and a greener future. Introducing ESG Funds where E stands for Environment, S for Social and G for Governance.The Environmental section sets the stage for companies that prioritise clean energy, waste reduction, and ecological conservation. The Social segment shines a spotlight on businesses that prioritize fair labour practices, human rights, and community development. And the Governance element ensures a strong melody of transparent leadership, ethical decision-making, and board diversity.Here, ESG Funds revolve around a specific theme, which centers on companies that hold the environment, social responsibility, and ethical governance in high regard. To put it simply, these funds are designed to invest selectively in businesses that place a significant emphasis on these crucial aspects.So What Are Thematic Mutual Funds?Thematic funds are a type of Mutual Fund schemes that are focused on specific themes or trends, such as clean energy or technology. These funds invest in companies that are related to the specific theme, in order to capitalise on growth opportunities and generate returns for investors. The five broad themes for which mutual fund schemes exist are dividend yield, PSU, MNC, Energy and consumption. Several smaller themes, such as manufacturing, quant, commodities, exports, services, and transportation, have one or two funds.Thematic Fundsare actively managed and aim to offer investors like you an opportunity to gain exposure to a targeted theme with the potential for high-growth opportunities and alignment with their values or beliefs and high risk. However, you should carefully evaluate the risks and potential rewards of investing in aThematic Fund.You should consult your financial adviser if you are in any doubt as to whether this product is suitable for you.These funds can be more volatile and may underperform depending on the concentration risk involved or external factors impacting their performance.How Does Thematic Investing WorkThematic Investing involves investing in companies that are connected to a specific theme or trend. The concept behind thematic investing is that certain industries or trends will perform well over time, and by investing in companies that are related to these themes, you may be able to achieve higher returns.Benefits of Investing inThematic FundsHere are some potential benefits of investing inThematic Funds:Exposure to High-Growth Sectors:Thematic Fundscan provide you exposure to high-growth sectors poised for significant future growth. For example, a thematic fund that invests in renewable energy companies may benefit from the growing demand for clean energy.Diversification:Investing in athematic fundcan provide diversification benefits to investors. These funds generally invest in a portfolio of companies related to a particular theme, which can help spread risk and reduce concentration in a single company or sector.Alignment with Personal Values:Thematic Fundscan also align with an investor's values or beliefs. For example, a thematic fund investing in companies focused on social impact may resonate with an investor prioritizing social responsibility.4.Potential for Long-term Returns:Thematic Funds that have exposure to a certain industry or sector that is booming may outperform the broader market if that sector performs well in the long run. However, investors should consider their risk appetite and read all scheme related documents carefully before investing. However, it's important to note that Thematic Funds may also underperform if the theme they invest in performs differently than expected. Thus, Thematic Funds may not always give you the returns you expect.Risks Associated with Thematic FundsWhile Thematic Funds offer many benefits to seasoned investors, they are not suitable for everyone. Here are some risks to consider when investing in Thematic Funds:1. Concentration RiskThematic funds invest in a specific sector or theme, which means they are exposed to concentration risk. If the theme underperforms or faces regulatory changes, it can have a significant impact on the fund's returns.2. VolatilityThematic funds tend to be more volatile than diversified funds because of their concentrated exposure to a specific sector/theme. This volatility can lead to significant fluctuations in returns and make them unsuitable for investors with a low risk tolerance.3. Liquidity RiskSome thematic funds invest in small-cap or mid-cap stocks, which may not have sufficient liquidity. This can make it challenging to exit the investment in times of market volatility or unfavourable market conditions.4. Performance RiskThematic funds can offer higher returns, but there is no guarantee that they will outperform the broader market or diversified funds. Investing in thematic funds requires a thorough understanding of the sector/theme and the underlying companies' performance.In order to make an informed investment decision, it is important to read the fund and offering documents carefully, especially for thematic funds. The risk-o-meter in these documents provides a visual representation of the risk level of the scheme compared to other funds. In addition, it is useful to assess the risk of the fund against relevant benchmarks or the average risk of other funds in the same category.TakeawayThematic Fundshas the potential to offer investors exposure to high-growth sectors, diversification benefits, alignment with personal values, active management, and potential for outperformance. However, you should carefully evaluate the risks and potential rewards before investing in athematic fund. As with any investment, you must do your due diligence, understand the investment strategy, track record, and fees, and make an informed decision based on your investment goals and risk tolerance.DisclaimerMutual Fund investmentsare subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.2",

If an investment of Rs1000 made 5 years ago is worth Rs.1800 today, while the absolute growthrateis80%, its CAGR isthe average return the investment earned every year. The CAGR works out to be12.5%.If you had to compare this with a bank FD that promised12.5% per annum, CAGR makes it easier to compare.Similarly, if you had tocalculatethe return earned by your investment after removing inflation, which is an annual figure of say 4%, CAGR makes it simpler to calculate that you really earned 8.5% after removinginflation. CAGR is useful when returns arecomparedfor period greater than one year.The investment may have given more than12.5% in some years and less than12.5% in other years but on anaverage, itgrew by12.5% annually during the 5-year period.2",

They can continue with their SIPs year after year as they continue to remain employed.While the lock-in period of 3yrs is essential, an investor has the option to continue his investment even after the lock-in period is over unlike in the case of other tax saving products where your money automatically matures or stops earning interest after the lock-in period is over. An investor can stay invested in the fund for as long as he/she wants and the longer the investor stays put, lower is his/her investment risk while chances of earning a higher return goes up with time.2",

Large-cap refers to the top 100 publicly listed companies in India by full market capitalization (market capitalization = no. of publicly listed shares * price of each share).Bluechip stocks often refer to the stocks of the biggest companies of an economy that are publicly listed. Large-cap mutual funds invest 80% of their assets in such blue-chip stocks. Hence some AMCs choose to label their large-cap funds asBluechip Mutual Funds.Next time you want to invest in a well-diversified equity fund with stable return potential, dont get bogged down by their names. Look for the category they fall into and if they are classified as large cap funds, thats where you need to carry out your next step of analysis and selection before finalizing a fund.",

        "question": "Portfolio Diversification & Its Benefits",
        "answer": "\"Never put all your eggs in one basket\".Achieving a balance between risk and return is crucial when making investment decisions. Diversification is a key strategy for achieving this balance, as it allows you to spread your investments across different asset classes and sectors, reducing your exposure to any one particular risk.In this article, we will look into what portfolio diversification is, especially related to mutual funds, and how it can help you achieve the returns on investment that you are looking for.What is Portfolio Diversification?When you go out for dinner, you often order a well-rounded meal for maximum satisfaction. You may order a soup, an appetiser, a main course, a dessert, and perhaps some drinks. This ensures that you get a variety of flavours and textures. Also, if one course is not satisfying, there is a chance that another course can make up for its flavourlessness.Think of portfolio diversification in a similar manner. Portfolio diversification involves investing in a variety of instruments for better risk-adjusted returns, i.e. reduce risk and maximise returns. It involves spreading your investments across asset classes like stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate, and other alternative investments. Instead of directly buying in multiple markets like equity, debt, commodities, you can invest in all markets through a single Mutual Fund Scheme.For instance, Multi Asset Allocation Funds invest in a minimum of three asset classes with each class allocated at least 10%. Similarly, Multi-Cap Funds allocate a minimum of 65% of their investments to equity and equity-related instruments across stocks from various sectors and market segments. This diversification helps reduce the risk associated with having excessive exposure to a small number of stocks, sectors, or segments.Moreover, you can invest in different mutual fund schemes for different goals. For instance, you may invest in debt funds for short-term goals, equity funds for long-term goals and hybrid funds for medium-term goals.Each of these funds come with their own benefits and have a certain amount of risk that they carry. When you invest in a variety of mutual funds, specific to your goals, you can mitigate the risk to your overall portfolio.Diversification can also provide the opportunity to gain from different market areas, which helps maximise returns while minimising riskAmong mutual funds itself, there are certain categories of mutual funds that provide inherent diversification. For instance, multi-cap funds invest in small-cap, mid-cap and large-cap companies across different sectors and industries. Investing in multi-cap funds can help you get access to a wide range of company equities. Similarly, if you want a risk-balanced mutual fund investment, you could invest in a hybrid fund that invests equally in debt and equity investments.However, do remember that diversification neither guarantees success nor provides loss protection. Consider the investment objectives of mutual fund schemes before making investment decisions.What Are The Benefits Of Portfolio Diversification?1)Risk ManagementWhen you diversify your portfolio, you ensure that if one asset class underperforms, other assets may compensate. Not all assets perform equally, and diversification allows you to reduce your risk. For instance, if equities underperform, debt instruments and gold will typically perform better. If you invest in a diversified mutual fund or have a portfolio that includes mutual fund investments across different assets, then your overall risk and returns will be balanced out.2)Protection Against Market VolatilityA diverse portfolio lowers the overall risk of the portfolio. The total impact of market volatility is reduced due to investment diversification across asset classes and industries. Higher volatility in returns implies a riskier asset, and because of this, returns on risky assets are usually higher than returns on assets with lower risk. For instance, if you invest in equities and bonds of the same company, the return on investment in equities will be higher than return on investment on bonds. Risk in equities will also be higher. When you include both debt and equity in your portfolio, you ensure that the positive returns from one asset class could possibly compensate for lower or negative returns from another asset class.3)GoalsDiversification may help you attain specific financial goals. The objectives may change over time; achieving them may require flexible investing strategies. For instance, say you want to take yearly holidays, save for retirement, and pay your child's college expenses, you may need different mutual fund investments depending on the objective and the time horizon that will help you plan for each of these goals. If in doubt, consult your financial adviser.4)Long-Term PerformanceOver the long term, a well-diversified portfolio may have the potential to provide a stable investment experience and may be better positioned to withstand market volatility.5)Time Saving and ConvenientDiversified portfolios can also help you save time since you do not have to monitor every investment individually. Rather, you only need to monitor the portfolio's performance and make any necessary adjustments. If needed, you can always consult your Mutual Fund Distributor.TakeawayPortfolio diversification is crucial for any investor looking to manage risk and maximize returns. Investing in various Mutual Fund Schemes that provide exposure to different asset classes and sectors in the economy can minimise the impact of market fluctuations and economic uncertainties, and increase the likelihood of achieving long-term financial goals.DisclaimerThe information disseminated on AMFI website about various categories of mutual fund schemes is for informational purposes for creating awareness about mutual funds as a financial product category and not for sales promotion nor solicitation of business.The content herein has been prepared by AMFI on the basis of publicly available information, internal sources and other third-party sources believed to be reliable.

        "question": "Know more about long-term Mutual Fund Strategy",
        "answer": "Long-term investment involves holding assets for an extended period, typically for years or decades. This approach is advantageous as it effectively utilises compounding for substantial returns, allows investors to ride out market volatility, and provides stability against short-term fluctuations.Planning an effective long-term mutual fund strategy requires a thoughtful and well-considered approach. Firstly, clearly define your financial goals and time horizon. Identify the purpose of your investments, whether it's retirement planning, education funding, wealth accumulation or other. Next, assess your risk tolerance to determine the level of volatility you can comfortably handle. Lastly, according to your goals and risk tolerance, choose a mix of mutual funds that align with your objectives.Diversification is a key principle in constructing a strong mutual fund portfolio. By scattering investments across different asset classes, you can potentially reduce risk and improve the possibilities for long-term growth. This approach can not only safeguard your portfolio against market fluctuations but can also positions it for steady and sustained performance over the years.One of the notableadvantages of long-term mutual fund investmentsis the potential for compounding returns. Over an extended period, your initial investment has the opportunity to generate earnings, and these earnings, in turn, can also earn returns. Compounding allows your money to grow exponentially, providing a powerful mechanism for building wealth over time.Long-term mutual fund investments serve multifaceted purposes in financial planning. They are instrumental in retirement planning, forming a crucial component of portfolios by offering sustained growth over an extended period. Additionally, these investments play a key role inaccumulating funds for education, capitalising on their potential for capital appreciation. For individuals with a broader objective of wealth accumulation, mutual funds may provide a means for consistent and steady growth.Apart from strategies focused on specific goals, these investments play a role in ensuring financial security, serving as a dependable reserve for unexpected situations.Hence, a long-term mutual fund strategy is suitable for individuals seeking sustained financial growth and stability over an extended period.DisclaimerMutual Fund investmentsare subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.2",

        "answer": "After its launch in 1964, Mutual Funds have grown to manage assets over 17.37 lakh crores (as on Jan 31, 2017).This impressive growth is because of a strong Indian economy, better regulation, entry of reputed Indian and Foreign Asset Managers, and increasing acceptance ofMutual Fundsas a preferred asset class amongst Indian investors.It is interesting to note that the average investment in every individual retail investor account is \u20b9 68,086, indicating the acceptance of this asset class by the growing Indian middle class.India today has 42 Asset Management Companies (AMC) that help increase awareness and aid in spreading the message of Mutual Funds andfinancial planningto an increasingly aspirational country.Nearly 4000 crores is invested every month by way ofSystematic Investment Plans, another indicator of the trust and popularity of Mutual Funds in India.The Top 15 cities of India have 83% of total Mutual Fund Assets.

        "question": "Why do Debt Funds offer lower returns as compared to Equity Mutual Funds?",
        "answer": "Returns from Mutual Funds depend on the kind of investment it makes, and the risks associated with these investments. The taste of a cake differs from that of a samosa because both are made up of different ingredients and are prepared differently. Similarly,equity mutual fundsand Fixed Income Funds offer different kinds of returns because of the kind of securities that make up their portfolio and the way these securities generate their returns.Fixed income fundsinvest in interest paying securities like bonds, debentures and money market instruments. These securities promise to pay a fixed interest at regular intervals to theseMutual Funds. The rate is closely linked to the prevailing lending rates in the market. Since the issuers of these securities may fail to fulfill their promise, they promise to pay higher periodic interest than current lending rates as a compensation for the risk in such investments. A well-established corporate is likely to offer lower interest (lower risk premium) on its bonds as compared to a rookie company because its bonds carry a higher credit rating than the newer firm.Returns from an investment are directly linked to the risk involved. Usually debt securities are considered less risky than equities. Thus, lower risk investments like fixed income funds will offer lower returns unlike equity funds2",

        "answer": "ETFsare passive investment tools that track an underlying index and trade on exchanges just like shares. But ETFs need to be bought and sold from the exchange through a broker. You need to have a demat account to trade in ETFs and need to pay commission to the broker for every transaction. If you are tempted to invest in ETFs to capitalize on their real time trading, the commission cost can lower your returns over time.Secondly,ETFsdont offer the benefit of rupee cost averaging that is available inmutual fundsthroughSIP. If you want to make regular investment in ETFs, youll also have to bear the commission cost on every transaction. ETFs dont offer features like growth and dividend option where investors can choose an option best suited to their financial goals. For instance, ETFs cant meet the requirement of a retiree seeking regular income or someone seeking dividend payout on regular basis.Some ETFs are niche or sector specific and are thinly traded. Investors could face wide bid/ask spread (the deviation in current price ofETFfrom itsNAV) while transacting in ETFs. While ETFs offer intraday trading opportunities that may be tempting in the short-term, they could be detrimental to a long-term financial plan.2",

        "question": "Should you invest in ELSS under the new tax regime?",
        "answer": "The new tax regime effective from 1st Apr 2020 gives individuals and HUF taxpayers an option to choose between lower tax rates by forgoing certain exemptions and higher tax rates while availing exemptions (old tax regime). The newer tax regime may not suit everyone. Taxpayers need to evaluate the tax savings made under both the old and new regime to take a call.For taxpayers having home or education loans, tax deductible life insurance policies, a higher salary of more than 15lakhs, or who can save a lot through exemptions, the older regime may be more suitable. Hence these taxpayers can considerinvesting in ELSSto save tax under the old tax regime. The newer regime definitely saves you from a lot of paperwork at the end of the year in terms of submitting investment proofs as compared to the old tax regime but the old regime also helps you make few important investment and savings decisions. It forces you to make these investments or savings annually be it in ELSS, pension plan orPPF. Some taxpayers may already be havingSIPsin ELSS. They should evaluate the tax benefit under both regimes before stopping their SIPs.Which tax regime will help you save more on taxes will depend entirely on your income and salary structure? You should consult a tax consultant if you are unable to calculate your tax liability under both the tax regimes by yourself. Such a comparison only can guide you with your decision to continue investing in ELSS that not only helps save tax but offers you the growth potential of equities. Even if the new tax regime suits you better, you can still consider investing in ELSS from the wealth creation perspective. If you are someone who tends to withdraw during volatile markets, the lock-in period will help you stay put and ride over the volatility in the short-term. Since ELSS funds have a lock-in period of 3 years, if you invest today, you can take your money out only after 3 years in case of lumpsum investment. The lock-in period is also applicable to each SIP payment. If you want to withdraw the full amount invested over 12 months, you will have to wait till the last SIP instalment has completed 3 years.2",

        "question": "What is the difference between Mid-cap and Small-cap Funds?",
        "answer": "If you have been wondering whether mid-cap and small-cap funds are one and the same thing, you should definitely refer to SEBIsproduct categorization circularissued in Oct 2017 that came into effect in June 2018. These are two differenttypes of equity mutual fundsthat invest in different kinds of companies, as defined by their market sizes, and hence exhibit different risk-return profiles.There are many publicly listed companies on various exchanges in India. Mid-cap refers to the 101st to 250th company in terms of market capitalization (market capitalization = no. of publicly listed shares * price of each share) while 251st company onwards in terms of market capitalization are called small caps.A Mid-cap fund invests in mid-cap companies that have high growth potential but don't exhibit the risk associated with small caps since these companies have already attained a certain scale and stability. You can read more about mid-cap mutual funds in one of our articles:mutualfundssahihai.com/en/what-are-mid-cap-fundsA Small-cap fund invests in small-cap companies that are currently going through a high potential growth stage but are equally risky. Unlike the more stable large-cap stocks, small-cap stocks can be far more volatile.So mid-cap funds have the potential to offer higher returns than large-caps without being too risky like the small-cap fund category. But they still have some element of risk that is higher than those of large-cap funds.Given the kind of stocks they invest in, both midcaps and small cap funds are risky in the short to medium term. These funds are suitable for young investors in case they wish to plan for their long-term goals like retirement,child educationetc since they can afford to bear the volatility of these fund in the 5-7 yrs horizon. The reason for this volatility is that unlike bluechip stocks, the stocks in the portfolio of these funds are still in the initial growth phase and havent reached the stable growth phase of bluechip stocks.But that doesnt mean all young investors in their 20s or 30s need to have these funds in their portfolio. A young investor with moderate to high risk aversion should avoid these and instead stick to the more stable large-cap funds or explore multicap funds that have exposure to large caps, midcaps and small caps in the same proportion.2",

        "question": "What are Open-Ended Mutual Funds and Close-Ended Mutual Funds?",
        "answer": "Mutual Funds can be categorized into Open-Ended Mutual Funds and Close-Ended Mutual Funds. But what is the difference between the two? Lets find out.1) What Are They?What are Open-Ended Mutual Funds?Open-Ended Mutual Funds are a category of investments that allow investors to buy and sell units at any time. Once the New Fund Offer ends, the fund starts accepting investments within a few days. So investors can invest in the units of the scheme as per the Scheme Information Document at any time.What are Close-ended Mutual Funds?The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) defines close-ended funds as mutual funds that have fixed maturity date or fixed tenure. These mutual funds are available for subscription for a specified period of time when the scheme is launched and can be redeemed at the end of the investment period.2) How Do They Work?Open-Ended Mutual FundsAll Mutual Funds are first floated in the market through a New Fund Offer (NFO). Usually, an NFO is open for a maximum period of 15 days. Once the NFO is made, you can begin investing in Open-Ended Mutual Funds.When you invest in an Open-Ended Mutual Fund, you must buy or sell units at the Net Asset Value. NAV is the market value of all the securities the fund has invested in. The NAV fluctuates daily depending on the market value of the securities. There is no cap on the number of units these Mutual Funds can float, nor is there a maturity period.Open-Ended Mutual Funds are managed by professional Fund Managers who make investment decisions based on the funds objectives and offer documents. You can invest in these funds through Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), Lumpsum or Systematic Transfer Plans (STPs) as per the scheme information document.Close-Ended Mutual FundsA New Fund Offer (NFO) is the first-time subscription offer for a new scheme launched by the asset management companies (AMCs). It is the same for close-ended funds too. Once the NFO is launched, investors can buy units of the Mutual Fund at a specified price. Once the NFO ends, new investors cannot invest in the fund. However, the AMC may then list the Mutual Fund on a stock exchange for investors to invest in.As an investor, you may choose to hold the investment until maturity, when the fund will be liquidated, and you will be paid the NAV. Alternatively, if you are in urgent need of funds, you can sell your units on the secondary market as per the Scheme information document Closed-ended funds provide fund managers with the flexibility to allocate funds without the fear of outflows.3) What Are Their Advantages?Benefits of Open-Ended Mutual FundsIf you are considering investing in Open-Ended Mutual Funds, here are the advantages you should know about:1.LiquidityOpen-Ended Mutual Funds are liquid since you can buy and sell the units on any working day. There are no restrictions on when you can liquidate your investments.2. TransparencyOpen-Ended Mutual Funds are highly transparent with their records. You can see what securities they invest in, their past performance history, and the fund managers performance, among other things. This makes it easy for you to make an investment decision. However, as past performance is no guarantee of future performance, it is important to review your investments regularly and keep track..3.Systematic OptionsYou can invest in Open-Ended Mutual Funds through a lump sum, SIP, or STP. These options make it convenient for you to invest in the Mutual Fund Scheme according to your financial goals.4.Professional ManagementOpen-Ended Mutual Funds are managed by professional Fund Managers, making them ideal for those who cannot actively manage their own portfolio. Fund Managers make investment decisions based on the market scenario, research and Scheme offer document, saving you the trouble of monitoring the market at all times.Benefits of Close-Ended Mutual FundsWhile Open-Ended Mutual Funds provide advantages such as easy liquidity, transparency and flexibility of investments, Close-Ended Mutual Funds also have advantages.1.StabilityClose-ended Mutual Funds are considered more stable since they cannot be liquidated once the NFO ends. This feature gives Fund Managers a stable asset base, enabling them to create proper investment strategies. Maintaining liquidity is also easy since there are no/minimum redemptions until maturity.2.Immunity from Large FlowsAnother advantage that Close-ended Mutual Funds enjoy is that there are no significant deviations in the funds value because there are no inflows or outflows during the lock-in period. Put this in positive light  that FM can hold on to their investment strategies coz of min redemption pressure.3.Professionally ManagedClose-ended Mutual Funds are also managed by professional Fund Managers. Given the lock-in period, Fund Managers can devise investment strategies that enhance the funds performance instead of being caught up with managing liquidity. Difference between the topic and the explanation.How to Choose Between Open-Ended and Close-Ended Mutual Funds?When choosing between open-ended and close-ended mutual funds, you need to consider several factors:1.LiquidityOpen-ended mutual funds are more liquid because you can buy and sell units any time you wish. Close-ended mutual funds can be sold on an exchange but may not have as much liquidity as open-ended mutual funds.2. FeesOpen-ended mutual funds may be priced higher and have higher fees. Close-ended mutual funds typically have lower fees. If this is a factor for you, be sure to compare the fees before investing.3. Investment HorizonThe investment horizon for open-ended mutual funds is entirely up to the investor's preference and financial goals. Close-ended mutual funds may be suitable for investors who have specific goals and can sell them in the short term.4.FlexibilityYou can invest in open-ended mutual funds through a lump sum investment or through an SIP. However, since close-ended mutual funds have a limited investment window, you cannot invest in them through SIPs. Only lumpsum investments are allowed.Therefore, if you want more flexibility of investment, higher liquidity then open-ended mutual funds may be a better option for you. As always, ensure that you have done your research, understood your investment objectives and risk profile before you invest in any mutual fund. Check the schemes risk-o-meter, which tells you how risky a mutual fund investment is compared to other schemes in the market. It would also be helpful to check the benchmark risk-o-meter and compare it with the investment you are considering. This will help you make a more informed decision.Regardless of whether you invest in open-ended or close-ended mutual funds, ensure that you read all the scheme-related offer documents. Consult your financial advisor in case you want any clarifications.DisclaimerThe information disseminated on AMFI website about various categories of mutual fund schemes is for informational purposes for creating awareness about mutual funds as a financial product category and not for sales promotion nor solicitation of business.The content herein has been prepared by AMFI on the basis of publicly available information, internal sources and other third-party sources believed to be reliable.

You can set up your mutual fund portfolio with some basic guiding principles.A step-by-step guide to building your mutual fund portfolio:Understand Your Risk Tolerance:Your risk tolerance is the level of risk you are willing to take while investing in mutual funds. When you determine the amount of risk you can take for your investments, you can decide on thetypes of fundsthat are suitable for you. For instance, if you hold a high-risk tolerance, you can have maximum allocation in equities, while debt funds are more suitable for you if you are a risk-averse investor.Identification of Goals:Goals are a crucial aspect because all other future decisions would be anchored to them.

        "answer": "Imagine you are planning a holiday to the Maldives and you dont have much idea about the place. How would you plan your trip? You may either call up a travel agent and book your trip or spend hours researching places to stay, places to visit, modes of transport etc and finally draw up your itinerary, make your bookings. The difference between the two is that you choose to take help and do it through someone versus you do it completely on your own.Direct and Regular Plans also differ in the same way. When youinvest in a mutual fundthrough a distributor, your money is invested in a Regular Plan. When you invest directly with a fund, your money is invested in the Direct Plan of the scheme. While both plans give you access to the same scheme and portfolio, they only differ in their NAVs and expense ratio. Since a commission must be paid to the distributor in case of a Regular Plan, the expense ratio of Regular Plans is higher than that of Direct Plans. This leads to a slightly lowerNAVof the Regular Plan in comparison to Direct Plan of the same scheme.Investors who are comfortable doing the research and managing their investment portfolio by themselves can opt forDirect Planelse Regular Plan is more suitable.2",

        "question": "What are the limitations of Index Funds?",
        "answer": "Index fundssuffer from three key disadvantages owing to their passive style. They dont offer flexibility to the fund manager in managing market downsides. If the index being replicated by the fund is generating negative returns due to unfavourable economic or market conditions, an activefund managerhas the option to choose stocks to better manage the downside. But an index fund must follow the benchmark, both during market up and downswings.An active fund manager tries to generate alpha i.e. an excess return over the funds benchmark. Hence active funds can generate returns higher than their benchmark by taking additional risk. But index funds are low-risk products that simply mimic an underlying benchmark. Hence an investor seeking return in excess of the benchmark index should avoid an index fund as they generate average market return.While index funds are meant to follow an index and deliver returns in line with it, in real life most index funds lag their benchmark returns due to the presence of tracking error. An index fund incurs cost every time it has to adjust its portfolio following changes to the composition of its index. The index doesnt incur any such transaction costs when its composition changes. The transaction costs incurred by the index fund lower its return vis-\u00e0-vis its benchmark return.2",

        "answer": "ETFs offer diversification benefit at a low cost. In spite of thesebenefits, one shouldmake note of the risks that are involved with suchinvestments. Firstly, there are many kinds of ETFs available in the market including international and exotic ones. Hence selecting the right ETF to meet your need is the key to avoiding additional risks like political risk and liquidity risk that may be associated with these ETFs.ETFs can also be exposed to counterparty risk and currency risk depending on their underlying holdings.ETFscan have different structures depending on what they invest in and how they distribute the capital gains from the portfolio.This can affect the tax liability for the investor. For instance, ETFs using in-kind exchanges do not distribute capital gains to end investors while ETFs involving derivatives or commodities may have complex structures and tax implications. Unless an investor is aware of these things, he may be caught off-guard.ETFs are exposed to market risk like stocks and otherMutual Funds in spite of theirdiversificationbenefits. The broader the index an ETF tracks, the lesser will be its marketriskbut it cant be completely eliminated. ETFs face tracking error i.e.their return will deviate from the return of the underlying index because an ETF incurs certain expenses that the index doesnt face.2",

        "answer": "Have you ever come across fund names like XYZ Multi Cap Fund while looking for information on mutual funds and wondered how these are different from the more popular large-cap funds? As the name suggests, a Multicap fund invests across large, mid, and small cap companies thus offering diversification across market caps in its portfolios.As per SEBIsproduct categorization circularissued in Oct 2017 that came into effect in June 2018, equity funds can be classified into large caps, mid caps, and small caps based on the kind of stocks they hold in their portfolio. There are many publicly listed companies on various exchanges in India. Large cap refers to the top 100 publicly listed companies in India by full market capitalization (market capitalization = no. of publicly listed shares * price of each share). Mid cap refers to the 101st to 250th company in terms of full market capitalization, while 251st company onwards in terms of full market capitalization are called small caps.Large cap funds invest in the large cap companies which have a predictable and stable growth potential while small cap funds invest in small cap companies that are currently going through a high potential growth stage but are equally risky.Large cap fundsare likely to give lower but stable returns unlike small cap funds which can be more volatile in the short term. Mid cap fund invests in the mid cap companies that have high growth potential but don't exhibit the risk associated with small caps since these companies have already attained certain scale and stability.Mid cap fundsmay offer higher returns than large caps without being too risky like the small cap funds. But they still have some element of risk that is higher than those of large cap funds.SEBIhas issued clear guidelines (on September 11, 2020), for asset allocation across the different market cap segments that the Multicap Mutual Fund category must follow. Multi cap funds are required to hold at least 75% of their assets in equity and equity related instruments at any point in time. The portfolio must allocate at least 25% of its assets to large-cap stocks, 25% to mid-cap stocks, and another 25% to small-cap stocks. While a Multicap Growth Fund is a good option for diversification and long-term wealth creation, it can also be very risky in the short-term since it has at least 50% exposure to small and mid-cap stocks which are very risky in the short-term. The upper limit for market cap exposure also limits thefund managersflexibility to switch allocation between various market cap stocks depending on his/her market outlook.Investors should carefully evaluate their existingMutual Fund investmentsand current exposure to the various market cap segments before adding a Multicap Fund to their portfolio. Multi cap funds are unsuitable for those who have a time horizon of less than 5-7 years or have low risk appetite.2",

        "question": "7 Reasons Why You Should Start Retirement Planning Early",
        "answer": "Planning for retirement early is like building a house. For retirement planning to be successful, a solid financial foundation is just as important as a solid foundation for a house.The first step in building a house is creating a blueprint and determining the materials needed. The same goes for retirement planning; you will have to identify which investment vehicles will help you to reach the expected retirement corpus at the time you expect to retire.As construction progresses, it is important to periodically evaluate progress, make necessary adjustments, and ensure that the structure meets its intended purpose. In the same way, you must periodically review your portfolio and adjust your plan if necessary to ensure your financial goals are met.Lastly, once the house is completed, you will have a place to live that is comfortable and safe. Likewise, adopting an early and disciplined approach to savings and investments may contribute to a comfortable and secure retirement for you.Here Are the Seven Reasons Why You Should Start Retirement Planning Right Now1.Cost of living keeps risingThe cost of living in India is constantly rising, and its likely to continue to be so. This means that its important to start saving for retirement as early as possible to ensure that you have enough money to continue with your lifestyle after retirement.2.Inflation could eat into your investmentsThe rate at which the cost of goods and services rises over time is known as inflation. Inflation can be a significant concern, and it can eat into your investments over time if you dont plan for it. The cost of delay in investments can be significant when inflation rises.3.More time to re-adjust your portfolioStarting your retirement planning early can give you more time to adjust your investment portfolio and make changes as needed. This can help you better manage your risk and maximize your returns over time. When in doubt, it's advisable to consult your financial advisors for guidance and clarification.4.Power of compoundingYour investment earnings are reinvested through the process of compounding, which over time, generates further returns. Starting your retirement planning early can give you more time to take advantage of the power of compounding, resulting in better returns on your investments. Lets take an example:DetailsStart investing at 25Start investing at 30Start investing at 35Time to retirement (assuming you retire at 60) (a)353025Amount invested per month (b)Rs 10,000Rs 10,000Rs 10,000Assumed Return on Investment*10%10%10%Invested amountRs 42 lakhRs 36 lakhRs 30 lakhTotal corpus accumulated with returnsRs 3.8 croreRs 2.26 croreRs 1.34 croreCost of delayed investment-Rs 1.2 croreRs 2.5 crore* The above calculations are for illustration purposes only. Invested amount was calculate using the formula: a*b*12. The total corpus accumulated with returns was calculated using the SIP calculator. The cost of delaying investment was determined by subtracting the total corpus accumulated at a specific age from the total corpus built since the age of 25.5.Opportunity to earn returnsInvesting early increases your chances of finding investment opportunities with the potential to earn returns in the long run. By giving yourself more time to research and analyse different options, you may potentially accelerate the growth of your retirement savings and be better prepare for your financial needs in retirement.6.Early planning can reduce stressThe earlier you start investing, the easier it will be to plan for and save for the future, making it less stressful.7. Retire on your own termsStarting your retirement planning early can give you more control over when and how you retire. Moreover, at a young age, you may have fewer responsibilities and goals making it more feasible to invest for retirement. This may offer you the flexibility to retire when you want and on your own terms rather than being forced to work longer than youd like.Final WordPlanning your retirement is essential to ensuring your security and safety as you enter your golden years. You should start retirement planning as soon as possible. Certain Mutual Fund schemes fall under the category of solution-oriented retirement plans, specifically designed for retirement planning. However, you also have the option to invest in other types of Mutual Fund schemes and earmark them for retirement. If you have any concerns or questions, it is advisable to seek guidance from your Mutual Fund Distributor.However, it is important not to delay retirement planning at the risk of paying higher investment premium. Start early to give yourself the best opportunity for a stress-free and relaxing transition into retirement.DisclaimerMutual Fund investmentsare subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.2",

        "question": "Who regulates Mutual Funds in India?",
        "answer": "Mutual funds are the modern day's go-to investment option. Therefore, it is important to know who regulates the mutual fund industry in India. The Securities and Exchange Board of India or SEBI regulates all aspects of mutual funds in India. It has laid down strict rules and regulations to ensure transparency, fairness, and investor protection in the mutual fund industry.SEBI was established in 1988 and derives its power from the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 1992 by law.A mutual fund is set up in the form of a trust, which has sponsor, trustees, Asset Management Company (AMC) and custodian. The trust is established by a sponsor or more than one sponsor who is like promoter of a company. The trustees of the mutual fund hold its property for the benefit of the unitholders. AMC approved by SEBI manages the funds by making investments in various types of securities. Custodian, who is required to be registered with SEBI, holds the securities of various schemes of the fund in its custody. The trustees are vested with the general power of supervision and direction over AMC. They monitor the performance and compliance of SEBI Regulations by the mutual fund. SEBI Regulations require that at least two-thirds of the directors of trustee company or board of trustees must be independent i.e. they should not be associated with the sponsors. Also, 50% of the directors of AMC must be independent.SEBI is typically in charge of the following:Registration and Approval:A mutual fund needs to be registered with SEBI; it can mobilize funds from the public under each of its schemes.Investor Protection:SEBI sets guidelines to ensure fair and ethical practices, preventing fraudulent activities and conflicts of interest that could harm investors.Disclosure Requirements:Mutual funds are required to adhere to specific disclosure norms set by SEBI from time to time.Code of Conduct:SEBI establishes a code of conduct for mutual funds,fund managers, and other key personnel involved in the mutual fund industry to ensure ethical behavior and professional standards.Periodic Reviews and Updates:SEBI makes sure that the regulatory framework remains robust and responsive to changing market conditions.Continuous Monitoring and Surveillance:SEBI conducts ongoing monitoring and surveillance of mutual funds to ensure compliance with regulatory norms. It has the authority to take corrective actions, impose penalties, or issue directives in case of any violations.All the above functions are carried out by Securities and Exchange Board of India to protect theinterests of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and toregulate securities market, by such measures as it thinks fit.DisclaimerMutual Fund investmentsare subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.2",

        "answer": "Once you invest in aMutual Fund scheme, any change you wish to make in terms of changing plans (Regular/Direct), options (Growth/Dividend) or changing schemes within the same fund house will be considered as a sale (redemption). Hence making any such change is possible but like redemption, these changes will attractexit loadand capital gains tax depending on how long you have been invested. The only difference between switching schemes and placing a redemption request is that in case of the former, the money is directly invested in the new scheme while in the latter, the money is credited to your account and you can choose to invest the redemption proceeds in a different scheme later.If youve invested in an equity-oriented scheme (EOS), and you switch your investments before completing a year, applicable exit load (if any) and short-term capital gains tax of 15% will be levied. In case youve completed more than a year, long-term capital gains tax of 10% will be levied on gains in excess of INR 1 lakh in that particular financial year.3",

        "question": "What are Target Maturity Funds?",
        "answer": "With the awareness ofmutual fundsrising and falling interest rates on guaranteed savings products, many risk-averse investors who were used to conventional products like bank fixed deposits,PPFs, and NSCs, have moved towards debt funds for good reasons. Such investors finddebt fundsto be less volatile compared to the more popular equity funds and more tax-efficient than their fixed deposits, PPFs, and NSCs with the potential of offering better returns. However, investors are still prone to default risk i.e risk of losing principal and interest payments, and interest rate risk i.e price fluctuations due to changes in interest rates.Target maturity funds (TMFs) help investors navigate the risks associated with debt funds better by aligning their portfolios with the maturity date of the fund. These are passive debt funds that track an underlying bond index. Thus, the portfolio of such funds comprises of bonds that are part of the underlying bond index, and these bonds have maturities hovering around the funds stated maturity. The bonds in the portfolio are held to maturity and all interest payments received during the holding period are reinvested in the fund. Thus, Target Maturity bond funds operate in an accrual mode like FMPs. However, unlike FMPs, TMFs are open-ended in nature and are offered either as target maturity debt index funds or target maturity bond ETFs. Thus, TMFs offer greater liquidity than FMPs.TMFs have a homogenous portfolio as far as duration is concerned since all the bonds in the funds portfolio are held to maturity and they mature around the same time as the funds stated maturity. By holding the bonds to maturity, the duration of the fund keeps falling with time and hence investors are less prone to price fluctuations caused by interest rate changes.TMFs are currently mandated to invest in government securities, PSU bonds, and SDLs (State Development Loans). Hence, they carry lower default risk compared to other debt funds. Since these funds are open-ended, investors can choose to withdraw his/her investment in case of any adverse development around the bond issuers like likelihood of a default or a credit downgrade.Despite their open-ended structure and promise for liquidity, Target Maturity Funds should ideally be held upto maturity as this provides some predictability of return, a factor important for investors shifting from traditional deposits to debt funds for the first time.2",

        "question": "What are the advantages of investing in Target Maturity Funds?",
        "answer": "Over the years, investors have been moving from traditional savings products like fixed deposits,PPFs, and post office savings schemes towards debt funds in search of better tax-adjusted returns. However, the uncertainty of returns and the risk of losing their principal weighs heavily on them while making the shift. Target Maturity Funds (TMFs) are passive debt funds that offer several advantages over other debt funds including FMPs.Before we move to target maturity fund benefits, lets see whats the defining feature of this category of debt funds.Target maturity fundshave a specified maturity date and the expiry date of the bonds in its portfolio are aligned with this maturity date. Thus, the duration or time to maturity of the fund keeps reducing as time progresses. Also, all the bonds in the portfolio are held to maturity.The first and most promising advantage of TMFs is their relative immunity to interest rate changes. Since the portfolio is held to maturity and has a reducing duration, it is less sensitive to interest rate changes along the way.Secondly, TMFs have better return visibility than the rest of the debt funds since the portfolio of bonds is held to maturity. This keeps the return expectations in line with the funds Yield-to-Maturity (YTM) at any point in time. Thirdly, being passive in nature, target maturity bond funds deploy their funds based on the composition of the underlying bond index. Hence the portfolio of these funds tends to be heavily invested in government securities that make up most of the bond indices in India. At present target maturity funds have a mandate to invest in government bonds, PSU bonds, and State Development Loans. This lowers the default and credit risk of TMFs as compared to other debt funds.Since target maturity funds are open-ended and available as index funds or ETFs, they offer greater liquidity especially in comparison to FMPs that are not frequently traded. Also, they offer greater flexibility in terms of their maturity profile so that investors can choose a fund whose maturity date best suits their investment horizon.Investors looking to stay invested for some time and having expectations of a stable return should consider adding Target Maturity debt index fund or target maturity ETFs to their core debt fund investment portfolio.2",

Debt Mutual Fundsinvest in debt securities like Government bonds, Company bonds, Money market securities. Bonds are issued by corporates like power companies, banks, home finance companies and the Government. These bond issuers promise to pay their investors (those who buy their bonds), a periodic interest in return for their money invested in the bonds.Bond issuers are like the bank (borrower) in our FD example, borrowing money from investors and promising to pay periodic interest. While you are the investor in a bank FD,Debt Fundsare the investors in these bonds. Just like you earn interest from an FD, Debt Fundsearn periodic interests from their bonds portfolio. Unlike assured interest from FDs, periodic interest payments to fixed income Debt Funds from these bonds can be fixed or variable without any guarantee.

        "question": "What are the disadvantages of investing in Target Maturity Funds?",
        "answer": "Target Maturity Funds (TMFs) are a kind of open-ended debt funds that offer you fixed maturity dates. The portfolios of these funds carry bonds whose expiry date is aligned with the funds target maturity date and all the bonds are held to maturity. While this helps in lowering interest rate risk and makes returns more predictable, investors must keep in mind the drawbacks of TMFs before investing in these funds.Target Maturity bond fundsare a new category ofdebt fundand hence there are few options available in this space. This may limit the choice of maturity available to an investor i.e investors keen on a specific maturity horizon may not be able to find a suitable fund. Also, the category doesnt have any performance track record to rely on.Target maturity fund benefitsinclude interest rate risk mitigation and return visibility. But both these benefits can work only if the investor remains invested in the fund till maturity. Hence, investors may end up earning lower returns and also be prone to interest rate volatility if they have to liquidate their investments before maturity during an emergency. TMFs should only be considered if you have a medium to the long-term goal of 5-7 years and if you can hold on to your investments till the fund matures.The biggest disadvantage ofTarget Maturity Fundsis that investors get locked into prevailing interest rates and this may have an adverse impact on the overall return especially when interest rates are likely to go up in the future. This is usually the case when the economy is just coming out of a recession or the government is likely to pull back an ongoing stimulus package because, in both of these scenarios, interest rates are usually at their lowest and hence are only likely to go up. Rising interest rates have an adverse impact on bond prices and debt fund returns.Since TMFs invest in an underlying bond index, these funds are prone to tracking error like any otherindex fund. While the category doesnt have a performance history, the underlying bond indices can be a reasonable indicator of the expected returns from a specific TMF. However, tracking error i.e the difference between actual fund returns and return of the benchmarks can be the spoilsports here in return predictability.Being passive in nature, thefund managerhas limited scope to manage various risks should the outlook for the debt market change in the short-term like a change in a credit rating or RBI making changes to interest rates. The manager has no choice but to hold on to the bonds in the underlying index irrespective of his/her outlook. Hence, this may not be favourable to investors who are looking for short-term investments in debt funds. They would be better off investing in shorter maturity funds instead of TMFs.It is advisable to weigh the pros and cons of Target maturity funds carefully before choosing to include them in your investment portfolio. Also, a Demat account is mandatory for investing inTarget Maturity Fundsthat are available inETFformat which could be a limitation in case you dont have one.2",

        "answer": "Debt mutual fund investors are faced with two primary risks, interest rate risk and credit risk. While long-duration G-Secs address credit risk well, they are prone to high-interest rate risk. On the other hand, short-duration funds orliquid fundsoffer better management of interest rate risk but suffer from credit quality issues.FMPs andTarget Maturity fundshave fixed maturities and hence are better placed to manage interest rate risk through a buy and hold strategy. However, Target Maturity Funds score a few points above FMPs in certain respect. Apart from addressing interest rate risk, they are also better placed to handle credit risk as compared to FMPs since their portfolio consists of G-secs, State Development Loans and AAA-rated PSU bonds.FMPs are close-ended funds and even though they are listed on exchanges, they dont offer much liquidity due to low transaction volumes.Target Maturity bond fundsare open-ended in nature and hence offer better liquidity. Target Maturity Funds are also available in three different formats i.e they are available asTarget Maturity Bond Index FundsandTarget Maturity Bond ETFs. Thus, Target Maturity Funds offer more choices to investors in terms of the structure of the fund.Being passive in nature, Target Maturity Funds have a lower expense ratio compared to FMPs where thefund managerhas to build the portfolio. Target Maturity Funds also offer greater choice in terms of maturity ranging from 3-10 years while most FMPs are usually in the 1-3 yr range. Hence FMPs may not be suitable for investors having longer goal horizons.FMPs score over Target Maturity Funds in one aspect because they are close ended. While this limits their liquidity, it also forces serious investors to stay invested till the fund matures and hence protects them from interest rate risk. Since Target Maturity Funds are open-ended, that doesnt mean you should invest in them without committing yourself to remain invested till the maturity date. If you fail to do so, the whole premise of locking in a yield and interest rate risk protection is lost. Hence Target Maturity Funds are suitable for only those investors who can stay put till the maturity date of the fund and the whole goal horizon matches the funds maturity date.2",

Hence, we must eat different kinds of food in the right proportion to maintain our body.

Within the portfolio, we need a mix of different kinds of assets that play different roles like the various nutrients in our diet.

Thus,debt fundsearn regular interest income from such securities held in their portfolio. The interest earned by a debt fundfrom its bond portfolio can either be distributed among investors or accrued to the fund i.e. added to the fund assets, leading to an increase inNAV. Thus, unlike equity funds which depend on divided distribution from their portfolio of stocks, debt funds have a regular interest income, from the underlying portfolio, built into their features.As an investor, you can opt for a dividend payout option if you wish to receive regular income from your debt funds. While the option is named as Dividend Payout, it distributes the interest income and other capital gains earned from its portfolio at regular intervals. Even though the portfolio of a Debt Fundcomprises of interest-paying securities, making its dividend distribution more predictable and regular than that of anEquity Mutual Fund, these dividends are not guaranteed. Dividends are paid only when the fund has a distributable surplus. Talk about distributable surplus and that income will not be regular always.3",

        "answer": "Debt Fundsinvest the money pooled from investors in bonds issued by banks, PSUs, PFIs (Public Financial Institutions), corporates and the Government. These bonds are usually medium to long-term in nature. When a Mutual Fund invests in such bonds, it earns periodic interest from these bonds which contribute to the funds total return over time.SomeDebt Fundsalso invest in money market instruments like T-bills issued by the Government, Commercial Papers, Certificates of Deposits, Bankers Acceptance, Bills of Exchange, etc. which are more short-term in nature. These instruments also promise to make fixed interest payments at regular intervals which contribute to the funds overall return over time.While both bonds and money market instruments promise their investors i.e. yourMutual Fundto make regular interest payments in the future, they may fail to meet these obligations under certain circumstances like financial distress. Hence, while Debt Funds are considered more stable than equity funds, they still carry some risk because these issuers may fail to make timely payments which form a significant portion of the funds total return.3",

        "question": "What is a Riskometer and what are the different levels?",
        "answer": "The riskometer is a standardised risk measurement scale introduced by theSecurities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)for Mutual Funds. Allmutual fund scheme documentshave to display the riskometer upfront and clearly so that investors know the risk associated with that particular fund.The riskometer classifies risk into six distinct levels. These include Low, Low to Moderate, Moderate, Moderately High, High and Very High. Refer to the provided illustration on the left side.Low Risk:The funds that fall under this category have the least risk due to their underlying securities, making them suitable for individuals seeking capital protection to some extent.Low to Moderate Risk:These are for investors willing to take a bit of risk to get some returns over a medium to long time. Most ultra-short duration funds fall under this category.Moderate Risk:This is ideal for investors who aim to expand their portfolio taking some risks. Most dynamic bond funds fall under this category.Moderately High Risk:These funds hold a somewhat higher level of risk and might suit investors with a slightly higher risk profile. These are for investors willing to accept some uncertainty and greater volatility in exchange for the prospect of achieving higher growth or profitability.High Risk:Funds in this category mainly invest in equities. They are ideal for those willing to take on high risk for prospective gains.Very High Risk:They are extremely risky funds that invest in volatile stocks or overseas mutual fund units. Theyre for investors who are likely to invest in high-risk, high-reward investment opportunities.DisclaimerMutual Fund investmentsare subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.2",

        "question": "Who should invest in Debt Funds?",
        "answer": "If someone asked you, who should eat more of proteins or carbohydrates or vitamins, what would be your answer?Everyone!Everybody needs to eat all kinds of nutrients, but the proportion of nutrients will vary for each person depending on age and physical requirements. For instance, growing children need more proteins and carbohydrates than adults. They also need sufficient supply of energy-rich carbohydrates. The same principle applies to your investment portfolio too.Each person needs to have a mix of equity,debt funds, gold, real-estate and other assets in his/her investment portfolio. But the proportion of each asset will vary for each person. Thus, everyone needs to have some exposure to fixed income assets like Debt funds. Senior citizens need to allocate more of their portfolio to Debt funds than youngsters in their 30s. Amongst the youngsters, a conservative investor who is uncomfortable taking high risk should invest more in Debt funds than his peers who may be more comfortable with the volatile nature of equity investing. As a thumb rule, it is recommended to allocate a proportion of your portfolio equal to your age to fixed income assets like Debt funds. NewMutual Fundinvestors can also start with debt funds.3",

        "question": "How do interest rate changes affect my return from Debt Funds?",
        "answer": "Debt Fundsinvest in fixed income securities like corporate or Government bonds and money market instruments. These securities are interest bearing instruments that pay a fixed interest (coupon rate) to investors at regular intervals and pay the invested amount (principal) at maturity. The prices of these securities are directly affected by interest rate changes. Bond prices and interest rates are inversely proportional.A bonds coupon rate is fixed at the time when the bond is first issued at certain price (Face Value). If interest rates fall below the coupon rate, the bond looks more attractive as it carries higher interest than currently available in the market. Hence, demand for such bonds go up, pushing their prices up. If interest rates rise, these bonds look unattractive and their prices fall due to lower demand.When interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall. This leads to a decline in theNAVoffixed income fundsthat hold these securities in their portfolio. On the other hand, when interest rates fall, prices of fixed income securities rise, leading to an increase in the NAVs of fixed income funds. Thus, you get a positive return from your fixed income fund investment when interest rates fall and vice-versa.3",
